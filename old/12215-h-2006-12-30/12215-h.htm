    THE MONEY-BOX
</h2>
<p>
    Sailormen are not good 'ands at saving money as a rule, said the
    night-watchman, as he wistfully toyed with a bad shilling on his
    watch-chain, though to 'ear 'em talk of saving when they're at sea
    and there isn't a pub within a thousand miles of 'em, you might think
    different.

<!--IMAGE END-->
<p>
    It ain't for the want of trying either with some of 'em, and I've known
    men do all sorts o' things as soon as they was paid off, with a view to
    saving.  I knew one man as used to keep all but a shilling or two in a
    belt next to 'is skin so that he couldn't get at it easy, but it was all
    no good.  He was always running short in the most inconvenient places.
    I've seen 'im wriggle for five minutes right off, with a tramcar
    conductor standing over 'im and the other people in the tram reading
    their papers with one eye and watching him with the other.
</p>
<p>
    Ginger Dick and Peter Russet&mdash;two men I've spoke of to you afore&mdash;tried
    to save their money once.  They'd got so sick and tired of spending it
    all in p'r'aps a week or ten days arter coming ashore, and 'aving to go
    to sea agin sooner than they 'ad intended, that they determined some way
    or other to 'ave things different.
</p>
<p>
    They was homeward bound on a steamer from Melbourne when they made their
    minds up; and Isaac Lunn, the oldest fireman aboard&mdash;a very steady old
    teetotaler&mdash;gave them a lot of good advice about it.  They all wanted to
    rejoin the ship when she sailed agin, and 'e offered to take a room
    ashore with them and mind their money, giving 'em what 'e called a
    moderate amount each day.
</p>
<p>
    They would ha' laughed at any other man, but they knew that old Isaac was
    as honest as could be and that their money would be safe with 'im, and at
    last, after a lot of palaver, they wrote out a paper saying as they were
    willing for 'im to 'ave their money and give it to 'em bit by bit, till
    they went to sea agin.
</p>
<p>
    Anybody but Ginger Dick and Peter Russet or a fool would ha' known better
    than to do such a thing, but old Isaac 'ad got such a oily tongue and
    seemed so fair-minded about wot 'e called moderate drinking that they
    never thought wot they was letting themselves in for, and when they took
    their pay&mdash;close on sixteen pounds each&mdash;they put the odd change in their
    pockets and 'anded the rest over to him.
</p>
<p>
    The first day they was as pleased as Punch.  Old Isaac got a nice,
    respectable bedroom for them all, and arter they'd 'ad a few drinks they
    humoured 'im by 'aving a nice 'ot cup o' tea, and then goin' off with 'im
    to see a magic-lantern performance.
</p>
<p>
    It was called "The Drunkard's Downfall," and it begun with a young man
    going into a nice-looking pub and being served by a nice-looking barmaid
    with a glass of ale.  Then it got on to 'arf pints and pints in the next
    picture, and arter Ginger 'ad seen the lost young man put away six pints
    in about 'arf a minute, 'e got such a raging thirst on 'im that 'e
    couldn't sit still, and 'e whispered to Peter Russet to go out with 'im.
</p>
<p>
    "You'll lose the best of it if you go now," ses old Isaac, in a whisper;
    "in the next picture there's little frogs and devils sitting on the edge
    of the pot as 'e goes to drink."
</p>
<p>
    "Ginger Dick got up and nodded to Peter."
</p>
<p>
    "Arter that 'e kills 'is mother with a razor," ses old Isaac, pleading
    with 'im and 'olding on to 'is coat.
</p>
<p>
    Ginger Dick sat down agin, and when the murder was over 'e said it made
    'im feel faint, and 'im and Peter Russet went out for a breath of fresh
    air.  They 'ad three at the first place, and then they moved on to
    another and forgot all about Isaac and the dissolving views until ten
    o'clock, when Ginger, who 'ad been very liberal to some friends 'e'd made
    in a pub, found 'e'd spent 'is last penny.
</p>
<p>
    "This comes o' listening to a parcel o' teetotalers," 'e ses, very cross,
    when 'e found that Peter 'ad spent all 'is money too.  "Here we are just
    beginning the evening and not a farthing in our pockets."
</p>
<p>
    They went off 'ome in a very bad temper.  Old Isaac was asleep in 'is
    bed, and when they woke 'im up and said that they was going to take
    charge of their money themselves 'e kept dropping off to sleep agin and
    snoring that 'ard they could scarcely hear themselves speak.  Then Peter
    tipped Ginger a wink and pointed to Isaac's trousers, which were 'anging
    over the foot of the bed.
</p>
<p>
    Ginger Dick smiled and took 'em up softly, and Peter Russet smiled too;
    but 'e wasn't best pleased to see old Isaac a-smiling in 'is sleep, as
    though 'e was 'aving amusing dreams.  All Ginger found was a ha'-penny, a
    bunch o' keys, and a cough lozenge.  In the coat and waistcoat 'e found a
    few tracks folded up, a broken pen-knife, a ball of string, and some
    other rubbish.  Then 'e set down on the foot o' their bed and made eyes
    over at Peter.
</p>
<p>
    "Wake 'im up agin," ses Peter, in a temper.
</p>
<p>
    Ginger Dick got up and, leaning over the bed, took old Isaac by the
    shoulders and shook 'im as if 'e'd been a bottle o' medicine.
</p>
<p>
    "Time to get up, lads?"  ses old Isaac, putting one leg out o' bed.
</p>
<p>
    "No, it ain't," ses Ginger, very rough; "we ain't been to bed yet.  We
    want our money back."
</p>
<p>
    Isaac drew 'is leg back into bed agin.  "Goo' night," he ses, and fell
    fast asleep.
</p>
<p>
    "He's shamming, that's wot 'e is," ses Peter Russet.  "Let's look for it.
    It must be in the room somewhere."
</p>
<p>
    They turned the room upside down pretty near, and then Ginger Dick struck
    a match and looked up the chimney, but all 'e found was that it 'adn't
    been swept for about twenty years, and wot with temper and soot 'e looked
    so frightful that Peter was arf afraid of 'im.
</p>
<p>
    "I've 'ad enough of this," ses Ginger, running up to the bed and 'olding
    his sooty fist under old Isaac's nose.  "Now, then, where's that money?
    If you don't give us our money, our 'ard-earned money, inside o' two
    minutes, I'll break every bone in your body."
</p>
<p>
    "This is wot comes o' trying to do you a favour, Ginger," ses the old
    man, reproachfully.
</p>
<p>
    "Don't talk to me," ses Ginger, "cos I won't have it.  Come on; where is
    it?"
</p>
<p>
    Old Isaac looked at 'im, and then he gave a sigh and got up and put on
    'is boots and 'is trousers.
</p>
<p>
    "I thought I should 'ave a little trouble with you," he ses, slowly, "but
    I was prepared for that."
</p>
<p>
    "You'll 'ave more if you don't hurry up," ses Ginger, glaring at 'im.
</p>
<p>
    "We don't want to 'urt you, Isaac," ses Peter Russet, "we on'y want our
    money."
</p>
<p>
    "I know that," ses Isaac; "you keep still, Peter, and see fair-play, and
    I'll knock you silly arterwards."
</p>
<p>
    He pushed some o' the things into a corner and then 'e spat on 'is 'ands,
    and began to prance up and down, and duck 'is 'ead about and hit the air
    in a way that surprised 'em.
</p>
<p>
    "I ain't hit a man for five years," 'e ses, still dancing up and down&mdash;
    "fighting's sinful except in a good cause&mdash;but afore I got a new 'art,
    Ginger, I'd lick three men like you afore breakfast, just to git up a
    appetite."

<p>
    "Look, 'ere," ses Ginger; "you're an old man and I don't want to 'urt
    you; tell us where our money is, our 'ard-earned money, and I won't lay a
    finger on you."
</p>
<p>
    "I'm taking care of it for you," ses the old man.
</p>
<p>
    Ginger Dick gave a howl and rushed at him, and the next moment Isaac's
    fist shot out and give 'im a drive that sent 'im spinning across the room
    until 'e fell in a heap in the fireplace.  It was like a kick from a
    'orse, and Peter looked very serious as 'e picked 'im up and dusted 'im
    down.
</p>
<p>
    "You should keep your eye on 'is fist," he ses, sharply.
</p>
<p>
    It was a silly thing to say, seeing that that was just wot 'ad 'appened,
    and Ginger told 'im wot 'e'd do for 'im when 'e'd finished with Isaac.
    He went at the old man agin, but 'e never 'ad a chance, and in about
    three minutes 'e was very glad to let Peter 'elp 'im into bed.
</p>
<p>
    "It's your turn to fight him now, Peter," he ses.  "Just move this piller
    so as I can see."
</p>
<p>
    "Come on, lad," ses the old man.
</p>
<p>
    Peter shook 'is 'ead.  "I have no wish to 'urt you, Isaac," he ses,
    kindly; "excitement like fighting is dangerous for an old man.  Give us
    our money and we'll say no more about it."
</p>
<p>
    "No, my lads," ses Isaac.  "I've undertook to take charge o' this money
    and I'm going to do it; and I 'ope that when we all sign on aboard the
    Planet there'll be a matter o' twelve pounds each left.  Now, I don't
    want to be 'arsh with you, but I'm going back to bed, and if I 'ave to
    get up and dress agin you'll wish yourselves dead."
</p>
<p>
    He went back to bed agin, and Peter, taking no notice of Ginger Dick, who
    kept calling 'im a coward, got into bed alongside of Ginger and fell fast
    asleep.
</p>
<p>
    They all 'ad breakfast in a coffee-shop next morning, and arter it was
    over Ginger, who 'adn't spoke a word till then, said that 'e and Peter
    Russet wanted a little money to go on with.  He said they preferred to
    get their meals alone, as Isaac's face took their appetite away.
</p>
<p>
    "Very good," ses the old man.  "I don't want to force my company on
    nobody," and after thinking 'ard for a minute or two he put 'is 'and in
    'is trouser-pocket and gave them eighteen-pence each.

<p>
    "Wot's this for?"  ses Ginger, staring at the money.  "Matches?"
</p>
<p>
    "That's your day's allowance," ses Isaac, "and it's plenty.  There's
    ninepence for your dinner, fourpence for your tea, and twopence for a
    crust o' bread and cheese for supper.  And if you must go and drown
    yourselves in beer, that leaves threepence each to go and do it with."
</p>
<p>
    Ginger tried to speak to 'im, but 'is feelings was too much for 'im, and
    'e couldn't.  Then Peter Russet swallered something 'e was going to say
    and asked old Isaac very perlite to make it a quid for 'im because he was
    going down to Colchester to see 'is mother, and 'e didn't want to go
    empty-'anded.
</p>
<p>
    "You're a good son, Peter," ses old Isaac, "and I wish there was more
    like you.  I'll come down with you, if you like; I've got nothing to do."
</p>
<p>
    Peter said it was very kind of 'im, but 'e'd sooner go alone, owing to
    his mother being very shy afore strangers.
</p>
<p>
    "Well, I'll come down to the station and take a ticket for you," ses
    Isaac.
</p>
<p>
    Then Peter lost 'is temper altogether, and banged 'is fist on the table
    and smashed 'arf the crockery.  He asked Isaac whether 'e thought 'im and
    Ginger Dick was a couple o' children, and 'e said if 'e didn't give 'em
    all their money right away 'e'd give 'im in charge to the first policeman
    they met.
</p>
<p>
    "I'm afraid you didn't intend for to go and see your mother, Peter," ses
    the old man.
</p>
<p>
    "Look 'ere," ses Peter, "are you going to give us that money?"
</p>
<p>
    "Not if you went down on your bended knees," ses the old man.
</p>
<p>
    "Very good," says Peter, getting up and walking outside; "then come along
    o' me to find a police-man."
</p>
<p>
    "I'm agreeable," ses Isaac, "but I've got the paper you signed."
</p>
<p>
    Peter said 'e didn't care twopence if 'e'd got fifty papers, and they
    walked along looking for a police-man, which was a very unusual thing for
    them to do.
</p>
<p>
    "I 'ope for your sakes it won't be the same police-man that you and
    Ginger Dick set on in Gun Alley the night afore you shipped on the
    Planet," ses Isaac, pursing up 'is lips.
</p>
<p>
    "'Tain't likely to be," ses Peter, beginning to wish 'e 'adn't been so
    free with 'is tongue.
</p>
<p>
    "Still, if I tell 'im, I dessay he'll soon find 'im," ses Isaac; "there's
    one coming along now, Peter; shall I stop 'im?"
</p>
<p>
    Peter Russet looked at 'im and then he looked at Ginger, and they walked
    by grinding their teeth.  They stuck to Isaac all day, trying to get
    their money out of 'im, and the names they called 'im was a surprise even
    to themselves.  And at night they turned the room topsy-turvy agin
    looking for their money and 'ad more unpleasantness when they wanted
    Isaac to get up and let 'em search the bed.
</p>
<p>
    They 'ad breakfast together agin next morning and Ginger tried another
    tack.  He spoke quite nice to Isaac, and 'ad three large cups o' tea to
    show 'im 'ow 'e was beginning to like it, and when the old man gave 'em
    their eighteen-pences 'e smiled and said 'e'd like a few shillings extra
    that day.
</p>
<p>
    "It'll be all right, Isaac," he ses.  "I wouldn't 'ave a drink if you
    asked me to.  Don't seem to care for it now.  I was saying so to you on'y
    last night, wasn't I, Peter?"
</p>
<p>
    "You was," ses Peter; "so was I."
</p>
<p>
    "Then I've done you good, Ginger," ses Isaac, clapping 'im on the back.
</p>
<p>
    "You 'ave," ses Ginger, speaking between his teeth, "and I thank you for
    it.  I don't want drink; but I thought o' going to a music-'all this
    evening."
</p>
<p>
    "Going to wot?" ses old Isaac, drawing 'imself up and looking very
    shocked.
</p>
<p>
    "A music-'all," ses Ginger, trying to keep 'is temper.
</p>
<p>
    "A music-'all," ses Isaac; "why, it's worse than a pub, Ginger.  I should
    be a very poor friend o' yours if I let you go there&mdash;I couldn't think of
    it."
</p>
<p>
    "Wot's it got to do with you, you gray-whiskered serpent?"  screams
    Ginger, arf mad with rage.  "Why don't you leave us alone?  Why don't you
    mind your own business?  It's our money."
</p>
<p>
    Isaac tried to talk to 'im, but 'e wouldn't listen, and he made such a
    fuss that at last the coffee-shop keeper told 'im to go outside.  Peter
    follered 'im out, and being very upset they went and spent their day's
    allowance in the first hour, and then they walked about the streets
    quarrelling as to the death they'd like old Isaac to 'ave when 'is time
    came.
</p>
<p>
    They went back to their lodgings at dinner-time; but there was no sign of
    the old man, and, being 'ungry and thirsty, they took all their spare
    clothes to a pawnbroker and got enough money to go on with.  Just to show
    their independence they went to two music-'ails, and with a sort of idea
    that they was doing Isaac a bad turn they spent every farthing afore they
    got 'ome, and sat up in bed telling 'im about the spree they'd 'ad.
</p>
<p>
    At five o'clock in the morning Peter woke up and saw, to 'is surprise,
    that Ginger Dick was dressed and carefully folding up old Isaac's
    clothes.  At first 'e thought that Ginger 'ad gone mad, taking care of
    the old man's things like that, but afore 'e could speak Ginger noticed
    that 'e was awake, and stepped over to 'im and whispered to 'im to dress
    without making a noise.  Peter did as 'e was told, and, more puzzled than
    ever, saw Ginger make up all the old man's clothes in a bundle and creep
    out of the room on tiptoe.
</p>
<p>
    "Going to 'ide 'is clothes?" 'e ses.
</p>
<p>
    "Yes," ses Ginger, leading the way downstairs; "in a pawnshop.  We'll
    make the old man pay for to-day's amusements."
</p>
<p>
    Then Peter see the joke and 'e begun to laugh so 'ard that Ginger 'ad to
    threaten to knock 'is head off to quiet 'im.  Ginger laughed 'imself when
    they got outside, and at last, arter walking about till the shops opened,
    they got into a pawnbroker's and put old Isaac's clothes up for fifteen
    shillings.

<p>
    First thing they did was to 'ave a good breakfast, and after that they
    came out smiling all over and began to spend a 'appy day.  Ginger was in
    tip-top spirits and so was Peter, and the idea that old Isaac was in bed
    while they was drinking 'is clothes pleased them more than anything.
    Twice that evening policemen spoke to Ginger for dancing on the pavement,
    and by the time the money was spent it took Peter all 'is time to get 'im
    'ome.
</p>
<p>
    Old Isaac was in bed when they got there, and the temper 'e was in was
    shocking; but Ginger sat on 'is bed and smiled at 'im as if 'e was saying
    compliments to 'im.
</p>
<p>
    "Where's my clothes?"  ses the old man, shaking 'is fist at the two of
    'em.
</p>
<p>
    Ginger smiled at 'im; then 'e shut 'is eyes and dropped off to sleep.
</p>
<p>
    "Where's my clothes?" ses Isaac, turning to Peter.  "Closhe?" ses Peter,
    staring at 'im.
</p>
<p>
    "Where are they?"  ses Isaac.
</p>
<p>
    It was a long time afore Peter could understand wot 'e meant, but as soon
    as 'e did 'e started to look for 'em.  Drink takes people in different
    ways, and the way it always took Peter was to make 'im one o' the most
    obliging men that ever lived.  He spent arf the night crawling about on
    all fours looking for the clothes, and four or five times old Isaac woke
    up from dreams of earthquakes to find Peter 'ad got jammed under 'is bed,
    and was wondering what 'ad 'appened to 'im.
</p>
<p>
    None of 'em was in the best o' tempers when they woke up next morning,
    and Ginger 'ad 'ardly got 'is eyes open before Isaac was asking 'im about
    'is clothes agin.
</p>
<p>
    "Don't bother me about your clothes," ses Ginger; "talk about something
    else for a change."
</p>
<p>
    "Where are they?"  ses Isaac, sitting on the edge of 'is bed.
</p>
<p>
    Ginger yawned and felt in 'is waistcoat pocket&mdash;for neither of 'em 'ad
    undressed&mdash;and then 'e took the pawn-ticket out and threw it on the
    floor.  Isaac picked it up, and then 'e began to dance about the room as
    if 'e'd gone mad.
</p>
<p>
    "Do you mean to tell me you've pawned my clothes?" he shouts.
</p>
<p>
    "Me and Peter did," ses Ginger, sitting up in bed and getting ready for a
    row.
</p>
<p>
    Isaac dropped on the bed agin all of a 'cap.  "And wot am I to do?" he
    ses.
</p>
<p>
    "If you be'ave yourself," ses Ginger, "and give us our money, me and
    Peter'll go and get 'em out agin.  When we've 'ad breakfast, that is.
    There's no hurry."
</p>
<p>
    "But I 'aven't got the money," ses Isaac; "it was all sewn up in the
    lining of the coat.  I've on'y got about five shillings.  You've made a
    nice mess of it, Ginger, you 'ave."
</p>
<p>
    "You're a silly fool, Ginger, that's wot you are," ses Peter.
</p>
<p>
    "Sewn up in the lining of the coat?"  ses Ginger, staring.
</p>
<p>
    "The bank-notes was," ses Isaac, "and three pounds in gold 'idden in the
    cap.  Did you pawn that too?"
</p>
<p>
    Ginger got up in 'is excitement and walked up and down the room.  "We
    must go and get 'em out at once," he ses.
</p>
<p>
    "And where's the money to do it with?"  ses Peter.
</p>
<p>
    Ginger 'adn't thought of that, and it struck 'im all of a heap.  None of
    'em seemed to be able to think of a way of getting the other ten
    shillings wot was wanted, and Ginger was so upset that 'e took no notice
    of the things Peter kept saying to 'im.
</p>
<p>
    "Let's go and ask to see 'em, and say we left a railway-ticket in the
    pocket," ses Peter.
</p>
<p>
    Isaac shook 'is 'ead.  "There's on'y one way to do it," he ses.  "We
    shall 'ave to pawn your clothes, Ginger, to get mine out with."
</p>
<p>
    "That's the on'y way, Ginger," ses Peter, brightening up.  "Now, wot's
    the good o' carrying on like that?  It's no worse for you to be without
    your clothes for a little while than it was for pore old Isaac."
</p>
<p>
    It took 'em quite arf an hour afore they could get Ginger to see it.
    First of all 'e wanted Peter's clothes to be took instead of 'is, and
    when Peter pointed out that they was too shabby to fetch ten shillings
    'e 'ad a lot o' nasty things to say about wearing such old rags, and at
    last, in a terrible temper, 'e took 'is clothes off and pitched 'em in a
    'eap on the floor.
</p>
<p>
    "If you ain't back in arf an hour, Peter," 'e ses, scowling at 'im,
    "you'll 'ear from me, I can tell you."
</p>
<p>
    "Don't you worry about that," ses Isaac, with a smile.  "I'm going to
    take 'em."
</p>
<p>
    "You?" ses Ginger; "but you can't.  You ain't got no clothes."
</p>
<p>
    "I'm going to wear Peter's," ses Isaac, with a smile.
</p>
<p>
    Peter asked 'im to listen to reason, but it was all no good.  He'd got
    the pawn-ticket, and at last Peter, forgetting all he'd said to Ginger
    Dick about using bad langwidge, took 'is clothes off, one by one, and
    dashed 'em on the floor, and told Isaac some of the things 'e thought of
    'im.
</p>
<p>
    The old man didn't take any notice of 'im.  He dressed 'imself up very
    slow and careful in Peter's clothes, and then 'e drove 'em nearly crazy
    by wasting time making 'is bed.
</p>
<p>
    "Be as quick as you can, Isaac," ses Ginger, at last; "think of us two
    a-sitting 'ere waiting for you."
</p>
<p>
    "I sha'n't forget it," ses Isaac, and 'e came back to the door after 'e'd
    gone arf-way down the stairs to ask 'em not to go out on the drink while
    'e was away.
</p>
<p>
    It was nine o'clock when he went, and at ha'-past nine Ginger began to
    get impatient and wondered wot 'ad 'appened to 'im, and when ten o'clock
    came and no Isaac they was both leaning out of the winder with blankets
    over their shoulders looking up the road.  By eleven o'clock Peter was in
    very low spirits and Ginger was so mad 'e was afraid to speak to 'im.
</p>
<p>
    They spent the rest o' that day 'anging out of the winder, but it was not
    till ha'-past four in the after-noon that Isaac, still wearing Peter's
    clothes and carrying a couple of large green plants under 'is arm, turned
    into the road, and from the way 'e was smiling they thought it must be
    all right.
</p>
<p>
    "Wot 'ave you been such a long time for?"  ses Ginger, in a low, fierce
    voice, as Isaac stopped underneath the winder and nodded up to 'em.
</p>
<p>
    "I met a old friend," ses Isaac.
</p>
<p>
    "Met a old friend?"  ses Ginger, in a passion.  "Wot d'ye mean, wasting
    time like that while we was sitting up 'ere waiting and starving?"
</p>
<p>
    "I 'adn't seen 'im for years," ses Isaac, "and time slipped away afore I
    noticed it."
</p>
<p>
    "I dessay," ses Ginger, in a bitter voice.  "Well, is the money all
    right?"
</p>
<p>
    "I don't know," ses Isaac; "I ain't got the clothes."
</p>
<p>
    "Wot?"  ses Ginger, nearly falling out of the winder.  "Well, wot 'ave
    you done with mine, then?  Where are they?  Come upstairs."
</p>
<p>
    "I won't come upstairs, Ginger," ses Isaac, "because I'm not quite sure
    whether I've done right.  But I'm not used to going into pawnshops, and I
    walked about trying to make up my mind to go in and couldn't."
</p>
<p>
    "Well, wot did you do then?"  ses Ginger, 'ardly able to contain hisself.
</p>
<p>
    "While I was trying to make up my mind," ses old Isaac, "I see a man with
    a barrer of lovely plants.  'E wasn't asking money for 'em, only old
    clothes."
</p>
<p>
    "Old clothes?" ses Ginger, in a voice as if 'e was being suffocated.
</p>
<p>
    "I thought they'd be a bit o' green for you to look at," ses the old man,
    'olding the plants up; "there's no knowing 'ow long you'll be up there.
    The big one is yours, Ginger, and the other is for Peter."
</p>
<p>
    "'Ave you gone mad, Isaac?"  ses Peter, in a trembling voice, arter
    Ginger 'ad tried to speak and couldn't.
</p>
<p>
    Isaac shook 'is 'ead and smiled up at 'em, and then, arter telling Peter
    to put Ginger's blanket a little more round 'is shoulders, for fear 'e
    should catch cold, 'e said 'e'd ask the landlady to send 'em up some
    bread and butter and a cup o' tea.
</p>
<p>
    They 'eard 'im talking to the landlady at the door, and then 'e went off
    in a hurry without looking behind 'im, and the landlady walked up and
    down on the other side of the road with 'er apron stuffed in 'er mouth,
    pretending to be looking at 'er chimney-pots.
</p>
<p>
    Isaac didn't turn up at all that night, and by next morning those two
    unfortunate men see 'ow they'd been done.  It was quite plain to them
    that Isaac 'ad been deceiving them, and Peter was pretty certain that 'e
    took the money out of the bed while 'e was fussing about making it.  Old
    Isaac kept 'em there for three days, sending 'em in their clothes bit by
    bit and two shillings a day to live on; but they didn't set eyes on 'im
    agin until they all signed on aboard the Planet, and they didn't set eyes
    on their money until they was two miles below Gravesend.

    THE CASTAWAY
</h2>
<p>
    Mrs. John Boxer stood at the door of the shop with her hands clasped on
    her apron.  The short day had drawn to a close, and the lamps in the
    narrow little thorough-fares of Shinglesea were already lit.  For a time
    she stood listening to the regular beat of the sea on the beach some
    half-mile distant, and then with a slight shiver stepped back into the
    shop and closed the door.
</p>

Hands Clasped on Her Apron.'
">
</center>
<!--IMAGE END-->
<p>
    The little shop with its wide-mouthed bottles of sweets was one of her
    earliest memories.  Until her marriage she had known no other home, and
    when her husband was lost with the <i>North Star</i> some three years before,
    she gave up her home in Poplar and returned to assist her mother in the
    little shop.
</p>
<p>
    In a restless mood she took up a piece of needle-work, and a minute or
    two later put it down again.  A glance through the glass of the door
    leading into the small parlour revealed Mrs. Gimpson, with a red shawl
    round her shoulders, asleep in her easy-chair.
</p>
<p>
    Mrs. Boxer turned at the clang of the shop bell, and then, with a wild
    cry, stood gazing at the figure of a man standing in the door-way.  He
    was short and bearded, with oddly shaped shoulders, and a left leg which
    was not a match; but the next moment Mrs. Boxer was in his arms sobbing
    and laughing together.
</p>
<p>
    Mrs. Gimpson, whose nerves were still quivering owing to the suddenness
    with which she had been awakened, came into the shop; Mr. Boxer freed an
    arm, and placing it round her waist kissed her with some affection on the
    chin.
</p>
<p>
    "He's come back!"  cried Mrs. Boxer, hysterically.
</p>
<p>
    "Thank goodness," said Mrs. Gimpson, after a moment's deliberation.
</p>
<p>
    "He's alive!"  cried Mrs. Boxer.  "He's alive!"
</p>
<p>
    She half-dragged and half-led him into the small parlour, and thrusting
    him into the easy-chair lately vacated by Mrs. Gimpson seated herself
    upon his knee, regardless in her excitement that the rightful owner was
    with elaborate care selecting the most uncomfortable chair in the room.
</p>
<p>
    "Fancy his coming back!" said Mrs. Boxer, wiping her eyes.  "How did you
    escape, John?  Where have you been?  Tell us all about it."
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Boxer sighed.  "It 'ud be a long story if I had the gift of telling
    of it," he said, slowly, "but I'll cut it short for the present.  When
    the <i>North Star</i> went down in the South Pacific most o' the hands got
    away in the boats, but I was too late.  I got this crack on the head with
    something falling on it from aloft.  Look here."
</p>
<p>
    He bent his head, and Mrs. Boxer, separating the stubble with her
    fingers, uttered an exclamation of pity and alarm at the extent of the
    scar; Mrs. Gimpson, craning forward, uttered a sound which might mean
    anything&mdash;even pity.
</p>
<p>
    "When I come to my senses," continued Mr. Boxer, "the ship was sinking,
    and I just got to my feet when she went down and took me with her.  How I
    escaped I don't know.  I seemed to be choking and fighting for my breath
    for years, and then I found myself floating on the sea and clinging to a
    grating.  I clung to it all night, and next day I was picked up by a
    native who was paddling about in a canoe, and taken ashore to an island,
    where I lived for over two years.  It was right out o' the way o' craft,
    but at last I was picked up by a trading schooner named the <i>Pearl,</i>
    belonging to Sydney, and taken there.  At Sydney I shipped aboard the
    <i>Marston Towers,</i> a steamer, and landed at the Albert Docks this
    morning."
</p>
<p>
    "Poor John," said his wife, holding on to his arm.  "How you must have
    suffered!"
</p>
<p>
    "I did," said Mr. Boxer.  "Mother got a cold?"  he inquired, eying that
    lady.
</p>
<p>
    "No, I ain't," said Mrs. Gimpson, answering for herself.  "Why didn't you
    write when you got to Sydney?"
</p>
<p>
    "Didn't know where to write to," replied Mr. Boxer, staring.  "I didn't
    know where Mary had gone to."
</p>
<p>
    "You might ha' wrote here," said Mrs. Gimpson.
</p>
<p>
    "Didn't think of it at the time," said Mr. Boxer.  "One thing is, I was
    very busy at Sydney, looking for a ship.  However, I'm 'ere now."
</p>
<p>
    "I always felt you'd turn up some day," said Mrs. Gimpson.  "I felt
    certain of it in my own mind.  Mary made sure you was dead, but I said
    'no, I knew better.'"
</p>
<p>
    There was something in Mrs. Gimpson's manner of saying this that
    impressed her listeners unfavourably.  The impression was deepened when,
    after a short, dry laugh <i>a propos</i> of nothing, she sniffed again&mdash;three
    times.
</p>
<p>
    "Well, you turned out to be right," said Mr. Boxer, shortly.
</p>
<p>
    "I gin'rally am," was the reply; "there's very few people can take me
    in."
</p>
<p>
    She sniffed again.
</p>
<p>
    "Were the natives kind to you?" inquired Mrs. Boxer, hastily, as she
    turned to her husband.
</p>
<p>
    "Very kind," said the latter.  "Ah! you ought to have seen that island.
    Beautiful yellow sands and palm-trees; cocoa-nuts to be 'ad for the
    picking, and nothing to do all day but lay about in the sun and swim in
    the sea."
</p>
<p>
    "Any public-'ouses there?" inquired Mrs. Gimpson.
</p>
<p>
    "Cert'nly not," said her son-in-law.  "This was an island&mdash;one o' the
    little islands in the South Pacific Ocean."
</p>
<p>
    "What did you say the name o' the schooner was?"  inquired Mrs. Gimpson.
</p>
<p>
    "<i>Pearl,</i>" replied Mr. Boxer, with the air of a resentful witness under
    cross-examination.
</p>
<p>
    "And what was the name o' the captin?"  said Mrs. Gimpson.
</p>
<p>
    "Thomas&mdash;Henery&mdash;Walter&mdash;Smith," said Mr. Boxer, with somewhat unpleasant
    emphasis.
</p>
<p>
    "An' the mate's name?"
</p>
<p>
    "John Brown," was the reply.
</p>
<p>
    "Common names," commented Mrs. Gimpson, "very common.  But I knew you'd
    come back all right&mdash;I never 'ad no alarm.  'He's safe and happy, my
    dear,' I says.  'He'll come back all in his own good time.'"
</p>
<p>
    "What d'you mean by that?" demanded the sensitive Mr. Boxer.  "I come
    back as soon as I could."
</p>
<p>
    "You know you were anxious, mother," interposed her daughter.  "Why, you
    insisted upon our going to see old Mr. Silver about it."
</p>
<p>
    "Ah!  but I wasn't uneasy or anxious afterwards," said Mrs. Gimpson,
    compressing her lips.
</p>
<p>
    "Who's old Mr. Silver, and what should he know about it?" inquired Mr.
    Boxer.
</p>
<p>
    "He's a fortune-teller," replied his wife.  "Reads the stars," said his
    mother-in-law.
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Boxer laughed&mdash;a good ringing laugh.  "What did he tell you?" he
    inquired.  "Nothing," said his wife, hastily.  "Ah!" said Mr. Boxer,
    waggishly, "that was wise of 'im.  Most of us could tell fortunes that
    way."
</p>
<p>
    "That's wrong," said Mrs. Gimpson to her daughter, sharply.  "Right's
    right any day, and truth's truth.  He said that he knew all about John
    and what he'd been doing, but he wouldn't tell us for fear of 'urting our
    feelings and making mischief."
</p>
<p>
    "Here, look 'ere," said Mr. Boxer, starting up; "I've 'ad about enough o'
    this.  Why don't you speak out what you mean?  I'll mischief 'im, the old
    humbug.  Old rascal."
</p>
<p>
    "Never mind, John," said his wife, laying her hand upon his arm.  "Here
    you are safe and sound, and as for old Mr. Silver, there's a lot o'
    people don't believe in him."
</p>
<p>
    "Ah! they don't want to," said Mrs. Gimpson, obstinately.  "But don't
    forget that he foretold my cough last winter."
</p>
<p>
    "Well, look 'ere," said Mr. Boxer, twisting his short, blunt nose into as
    near an imitation of a sneer as he could manage, "I've told you my story
    and I've got witnesses to prove it.  You can write to the master of the
    Marston Towers if you like, and other people besides.  Very well, then;
    let's go and see your precious old fortune-teller.  You needn't say who I
    am; say I'm a friend, and tell 'im never to mind about making mischief,
    but to say right out where I am and what I've been doing all this time.
    I have my 'opes it'll cure you of your superstitiousness."

<p>
    "We'll go round after we've shut up, mother," said Mrs. Boxer.  "We'll
    have a bit o' supper first and then start early."
</p>
<p>
    Mrs. Gimpson hesitated.  It is never pleasant to submit one's
    superstitions to the tests of the unbelieving, but after the attitude she
    had taken up she was extremely loath to allow her son-in-law a triumph.
</p>
<p>
    "Never mind, we'll say no more about it," she said, primly, "but I 'ave
    my own ideas."
</p>
<p>
    "I dessay," said Mr. Boxer; "but you're afraid for us to go to your old
    fortune-teller.  It would be too much of a show-up for 'im."
</p>
<p>
    "It's no good your trying to aggravate me, John Boxer, because you can't
    do it," said Mrs. Gimpson, in a voice trembling with passion.
</p>
<p>
    "O' course, if people like being deceived they must be," said Mr. Boxer;
    "we've all got to live, and if we'd all got our common sense fortune-tellers couldn't.  Does he tell fortunes by tea-leaves or by the colour
    of your eyes?"
</p>
<p>
    "Laugh away, John Boxer," said Mrs. Gimpson, icily; "but I shouldn't have
    been alive now if it hadn't ha' been for Mr. Silver's warnings."
</p>
<p>
    "Mother stayed in bed for the first ten days in July," explained Mrs.
    Boxer, "to avoid being bit by a mad dog."
</p>
<p>
    "Tchee&mdash;tchee&mdash;tchee," said the hapless Mr. Boxer, putting his hand over
    his mouth and making noble efforts to restrain himself; "tchee&mdash;tch
</p>
<p>
    "I s'pose you'd ha' laughed more if I 'ad been bit?"  said the glaring
    Mrs. Gimpson.
</p>
<p>
    "Well, who did the dog bite after all?"  inquired Mr. Boxer, recovering.
</p>
<p>
    "You don't understand," replied Mrs. Gimpson, pityingly; "me being safe
    up in bed and the door locked, there was no mad dog.  There was no use
    for it."
</p>
<p>
    "Well," said Mr. Boxer, "me and Mary's going round to see that old
    deceiver after supper, whether you come or not.  Mary shall tell 'im I'm
    a friend, and ask him to tell her everything about 'er husband.  Nobody
    knows me here, and Mary and me'll be affectionate like, and give 'im to
    understand we want to marry.  Then he won't mind making mischief."
</p>
<p>
    "You'd better leave well alone," said Mrs. Gimpson.
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Boxer shook his head.  "I was always one for a bit o' fun," he said,
    slowly.  "I want to see his face when he finds out who I am."
</p>
<p>
    Mrs. Gimpson made no reply; she was looking round for the market-basket,
    and having found it she left the reunited couple to keep house while she
    went out to obtain a supper which should, in her daughter's eyes, be
    worthy of the occasion.
</p>
<p>
    She went to the High Street first and made her purchases, and was on the
    way back again when, in response to a sudden impulse, as she passed the
    end of Crowner's Alley, she turned into that small by-way and knocked at
    the astrologer's door.
</p>
<p>
    A slow, dragging footstep was heard approaching in reply to the summons,
    and the astrologer, recognising his visitor as one of his most faithful
    and credulous clients, invited her to step inside.  Mrs. Gimpson
    complied, and, taking a chair, gazed at the venerable white beard and
    small, red-rimmed eyes of her host in some perplexity as to how to begin.
</p>
<p>
    "My daughter's coming round to see you presently," she said, at last.
</p>
<p>
    The astrologer nodded.
</p>
<p>
    "She&mdash;she wants to ask you about 'er husband," faltered' Mrs. Gimpson;
    "she's going to bring a friend with her&mdash;a man who doesn't believe in
    your knowledge.  He&mdash;he knows all about my daughter's husband, and he
    wants to see what you say you know about him."
</p>
<p>
    The old man put on a pair of huge horn spectacles and eyed her carefully.
</p>
<p>
    "You've got something on your mind," he said, at last; "you'd better tell
    me everything."
</p>
<p>
    Mrs. Gimpson shook her head.
</p>
<p>
    "There's some danger hanging over you," continued Mr. Silver, in a low,
    thrilling voice; "some danger in connection with your son-in-law.  There,"
    he waved a lean, shrivelled hand backward and for-ward as though
    dispelling a fog, and peered into distance&mdash;"there is something forming
    over you.  You&mdash;or somebody&mdash;are hiding something from me."
</p>

<!--IMAGE END-->
<p>
    Mrs. Gimpson, aghast at such omniscience, sank backward in her chair.
</p>
<p>
    "Speak," said the old man, gently; "there is no reason why you should be
    sacrificed for others."
</p>
<p>
    Mrs. Gimpson was of the same opinion, and in some haste she reeled off
    the events of the evening.  She had a good memory, and no detail was
    lost.
</p>
<p>
    "Strange, strange," said the venerable Mr. Silver, when he had finished.
    "He is an ingenious man."
</p>
<p>
    "Isn't it true?"  inquired his listener.  "He says he can prove it.  And
    he is going to find out what you meant by saying you were afraid of
    making mischief."
</p>
<p>
    "He can prove some of it," said the old man, his eyes snapping
    spitefully.  "I can guarantee that."
</p>
<p>
    "But it wouldn't have made mischief if you had told us that," ventured
    Mrs. Gimpson.  "A man can't help being cast away."
</p>
<p>
    "True," said the astrologer, slowly; "true.  But let them come and
    question me; and whatever you do, for your own sake don't let a soul know
    that you have been here.  If you do, the danger to yourself will be so
    terrible that even I may be unable to help you."
</p>
<p>
    Mrs. Gimpson shivered, and more than ever impressed by his marvellous
    powers made her way slowly home, where she found the unconscious Mr.
    Boxer relating his adventures again with much gusto to a married couple
    from next door.
</p>
<p>
    "It's a wonder he's alive," said Mr. Jem Thompson, looking up as the old
    woman entered the room; "it sounds like a story-book.  Show us that cut
    on your head again, mate."
</p>
<p>
    The obliging Mr. Boxer complied.
</p>
<p>
    "We're going on with 'em after they've 'ad sup-per," continued Mr.
    Thompson, as he and his wife rose to depart.  "It'll be a fair treat to
    me to see old Silver bowled out."
</p>
<p>
    Mrs. Gimpson sniffed and eyed his retreating figure disparagingly; Mrs.
    Boxer, prompted by her husband, began to set the table for supper.
</p>
<p>
    It was a lengthy meal, owing principally to Mr. Boxer, but it was over at
    last, and after that gentleman had assisted in shutting up the shop they
    joined the Thompsons, who were waiting outside, and set off for Crowner's
    Alley.  The way was enlivened by Mr. Boxer, who had thrills of horror
    every ten yards at the idea of the supernatural things he was about to
    witness, and by Mr. Thompson, who, not to be outdone, persisted in
    standing stock-still at frequent intervals until he had received the
    assurances of his giggling better-half that he would not be made to
    vanish in a cloud of smoke.
</p>
<p>
    By the time they reached Mr. Silver's abode the party had regained its
    decorum, and, except for a tremendous shudder on the part of Mr. Boxer as
    his gaze fell on a couple of skulls which decorated the magician's table,
    their behaviour left nothing to be desired.  Mrs. Gimpson, in a few
    awkward words, announced the occasion of their visit.  Mr. Boxer she
    introduced as a friend of the family from London.
</p>
<p>
    "I will do what I can," said the old man, slowly, as his visitors seated
    themselves, "but I can only tell you what I see.  If I do not see all, or
    see clearly, it cannot be helped."
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Boxer winked at Mr. Thompson, and received an understanding pinch in
    return; Mrs. Thompson in a hot whisper told them to behave themselves.
</p>
<p>
    The mystic preparations were soon complete.  A little cloud of smoke,
    through which the fierce red eyes of the astrologer peered keenly at Mr.
    Boxer, rose from the table.  Then he poured various liquids into a small
    china bowl and, holding up his hand to command silence, gazed steadfastly
    into it.  "I see pictures," he announced, in a deep voice.  "The docks of
    a great city; London.  I see an ill-shaped man with a bent left leg
    standing on the deck of a ship."
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Thompson, his eyes wide open with surprise, jerked Mr. Boxer in the
    ribs, but Mr. Boxer, whose figure was a sore point with him, made no
    response.
</p>
<p>
    "The ship leaves the docks," continued Mr. Silver, still peering into the
    bowl.  "As she passes through the entrance her stern comes into view with
    the name painted on it.  The&mdash;the&mdash;the&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>
<p>
    "Look agin, old chap," growled Mr. Boxer, in an undertone.
</p>
<p>
    "The North Star," said the astrologer.  "The ill-shaped man is still
    standing on the fore-part of the ship; I do not know his name or who he
    is.  He takes the portrait of a beautiful young woman from his pocket and
    gazes at it earnestly."
</p>
<p>
    Mrs. Boxer, who had no illusions on the subject of her personal
    appearance, sat up as though she had been stung; Mr. Thompson, who was
    about to nudge Mr. Boxer in the ribs again, thought better of it and
    assumed an air of uncompromising virtue.
</p>
<p>
    "The picture disappears," said Mr. Silver.  "Ah!  I see; I see.  A ship
    in a gale at sea.  It is the North Star; it is sinking.  The ill-shaped
    man sheds tears and loses his head.  I cannot discover the name of this
    man."
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Boxer, who had been several times on the point of interrupting,
    cleared his throat and endeavoured to look unconcerned.
</p>
<p>
    "The ship sinks," continued the astrologer, in thrilling tones.  "Ah!
    what is this?  a piece of wreck-age with a monkey clinging to it?  No,
    no-o.  The ill-shaped man again.  Dear me!"
</p>
<a name="image-9"><!--IMG--></a>

<!--IMAGE END-->
<p>
    His listeners sat spellbound.  Only the laboured and intense breathing of
    Mr. Boxer broke the silence.
</p>
<p>
    "He is alone on the boundless sea," pursued the seer; "night falls.  Day
    breaks, and a canoe propelled by a slender and pretty but dusky maiden
    approaches the castaway.  She assists him into the canoe and his head
    sinks on her lap, as with vigorous strokes of her paddle she propels the
    canoe toward a small island fringed with palm trees."
</p>
<p>
    "Here, look 'ere&mdash;" began the overwrought Mr. Boxer.
</p>
<p>
    "H'sh, h'sh!"  ejaculated the keenly interested Mr. Thompson.  "W'y don't
    you keep quiet?"
</p>
<p>
    "The picture fades," continued the old man.  "I see another: a native
    wedding.  It is the dusky maiden and the man she rescued.  Ah! the
    wedding is interrupted; a young man, a native, breaks into the group.  He
    has a long knife in his hand.  He springs upon the ill-shaped man and
    wounds him in the head."
</p>
<p>
    Involuntarily Mr. Boxer's hand went up to his honourable scar, and the
    heads of the others swung round to gaze at it.  Mrs. Boxer's face was
    terrible in its expression, but Mrs. Gimpson's bore the look of sad and
    patient triumph of one who knew men and could not be surprised at
    anything they do.
</p>
<p>
    "The scene vanishes," resumed the monotonous voice, "and another one
    forms.  The same man stands on the deck of a small ship.  The name on
    the stern is the Peer&mdash;no, Paris&mdash;no, no, no, Pearl. It fades from the
    shore where the dusky maiden stands with hands stretched out
    imploringly.  The ill-shaped man smiles and takes the portrait of the
    young and beautiful girl from his pocket."
</p>
<p>
    "Look 'ere," said the infuriated Mr. Boxer, "I think we've 'ad about
    enough of this rubbish.  I have&mdash;more than enough."
</p>
<p>
    "I don't wonder at it," said his wife, trembling furiously.  "You can go
    if you like.  I'm going to stay and hear all that there is to hear."
</p>
<p>
    "You sit quiet," urged the intensely interested Mr. Thompson.  "He ain't
    said it's you.  There's more than one misshaped man in the world, I
    s'pose?"
</p>
<p>
    "I see an ocean liner," said the seer, who had appeared to be in a trance
    state during this colloquy.  "She is sailing for England from Australia.
    I see the name distinctly: the <i>Marston Towers</i>.  The same man is on
    board of her.  The ship arrives at London.  The scene closes; another one
    forms.  The ill-shaped man is sitting with a woman with a beautiful face
    &mdash;not the same as the photograph."
</p>
<p>
    "What they can see in him I can't think," muttered Mr. Thompson, in an
    envious whisper.  "He's a perfick terror, and to look at him&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>
<p>
    "They sit hand in hand," continued the astrologer, raising his voice.
    "She smiles up at him and gently strokes his head; he&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>
<p>
    A loud smack rang through the room and startled the entire company; Mrs.
    Boxer, unable to contain herself any longer, had, so far from profiting
    by the example, gone to the other extreme and slapped her husband's head
    with hearty good-will.  Mr. Boxer sprang raging to his feet, and in the
    confusion which ensued the fortune-teller, to the great regret of Mr.
    Thompson, upset the contents of the magic bowl.
</p>
<p>
    "I can see no more," he said, sinking hastily into his chair behind the
    table as Mr. Boxer advanced upon him.
</p>
<p>
    Mrs. Gimpson pushed her son-in-law aside, and laying a modest fee upon
    the table took her daughter's arm and led her out.  The Thompsons
    followed, and Mr. Boxer, after an irresolute glance in the direction of
    the ingenuous Mr. Silver, made his way after them and fell into the rear.
    The people in front walked on for some time in silence, and then the
    voice of the greatly impressed Mrs. Thompson was heard, to the effect
    that if there were only more fortune-tellers in the world there would be
    a lot more better men.
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Boxer trotted up to his wife's side.  "Look here, Mary," he began.
</p>
<p>
    "Don't you speak to me," said his wife, drawing closer to her mother,
    "because I won't answer you."
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Boxer laughed, bitterly.  "This is a nice home-coming," he remarked.
</p>
<p>
    He fell to the rear again and walked along raging, his temper by no means
    being improved by observing that Mrs. Thompson, doubtless with a firm
    belief in the saying that "Evil communications corrupt good manners,"
    kept a tight hold of her husband's arm.  His position as an outcast was
    clearly defined, and he ground his teeth with rage as he observed the
    virtuous uprightness of Mrs. Gimpson's back.  By the time they reached
    home he was in a spirit of mad recklessness far in advance of the
    character given him by the astrologer.
</p>
<p>
    His wife gazed at him with a look of such strong interrogation as he was
    about to follow her into the house that he paused with his foot on the
    step and eyed her dumbly.
</p>
<p>
    "Have you left anything inside that you want?" she inquired.

<p>
    Mr. Boxer shook his head.  "I only wanted to come in and make a clean
    breast of it," he said, in a curious voice; "then I'll go."
</p>
<p>
    Mrs. Gimpson stood aside to let him pass, and Mr. Thompson, not to be
    denied, followed close behind with his faintly protesting wife.  They sat
    down in a row against the wall, and Mr. Boxer, sitting opposite in a
    hang-dog fashion, eyed them with scornful wrath.
</p>
<p>
    "Well?"  said Mrs. Boxer, at last.
</p>
<p>
    "All that he said was quite true," said her husband, defiantly.  "The
    only thing is, he didn't tell the arf of it.  Altogether, I married three
    dusky maidens."
</p>
<p>
    Everybody but Mr. Thompson shuddered with horror.
</p>
<p>
    "Then I married a white girl in Australia," pursued Mr. Boxer, musingly.
    "I wonder old Silver didn't see that in the bowl; not arf a fortune-teller, I call 'im."
</p>
<p>
    "What they see in 'im!" whispered the astounded Mr. Thompson to his wife.
</p>
<p>
    "And did you marry the beautiful girl in the photograph?" demanded Mrs.
    Boxer, in trembling accents.
</p>
<p>
    "I did," said her husband.
</p>
<p>
    "Hussy," cried Mrs. Boxer.
</p>
<p>
    "I married her," said Mr. Boxer, considering&mdash;"I married her at
    Camberwell, in eighteen ninety-three."
</p>
<p>
    "Eighteen ninety-three!" said his wife, in a startled voice.  "But you
    couldn't.  Why, you didn't marry me till eighteen ninety-four."
</p>
<p>
    "What's that got to do with it?" inquired the monster, calmly.
</p>
<p>
    Mrs. Boxer, pale as ashes, rose from her seat and stood gazing at him
    with horror-struck eyes, trying in vain to speak.
</p>
<p>
    "You villain!" cried Mrs. Gimpson, violently.  "I always distrusted you."

<p>
    "Over and over agin," assented Mr. Boxer, cheerfully.  "It's got to be a
    'obby with me."
</p>
<p>
    "Was the first wife alive when you married my daughter?" demanded Mrs.
    Gimpson.
</p>
<p>
    "Alive?" said Mr. Boxer.  "O' course she was.  She's alive now&mdash;bless

    He leaned back in his chair and regarded with intense satisfaction the
    horrified faces of the group in front.
</p>
<p>
    "You&mdash;you'll go to jail for this," cried Mrs. Gimpson, breathlessly.
    "What is your first wife's address?"
</p>
<p>
    "I decline to answer that question," said her son-in-law.
</p>
<p>
    "What is your first wife's address?"  repeated Mrs. Gimpson.
</p>
<p>
    "Ask the fortune-teller," said Mr. Boxer, with an aggravating smile.
    "And then get 'im up in the box as a witness, little bowl and all.  He
    can tell you more than I can."
</p>
<p>
    "I demand to know her name and address," cried Mrs. Gimpson, putting a
    bony arm around the waist of the trembling Mrs. Boxer.
</p>
<p>
    "I decline to give it," said Mr. Boxer, with great relish.  "It ain't
    likely I'm going to give myself away like that; besides, it's agin the
    law for a man to criminate himself.  You go on and start your bigamy
    case, and call old red-eyes as a witness."
</p>
<p>
    Mrs. Gimpson gazed at him in speechless wrath and then stooping down
    conversed in excited whispers with Mrs. Thompson.  Mrs. Boxer crossed
    over to her husband.
</p>
<p>
    "Oh, John," she wailed, "say it isn't true, say it isn't true."
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Boxer hesitated.  "What's the good o' me saying anything?"  he said,
    doggedly.
</p>
<p>
    "It isn't true," persisted his wife.  "Say it isn't true."
</p>
<p>
    "What I told you when I first came in this evening was quite true," said
    her husband, slowly.  "And what I've just told you is as true as what
    that lying old fortune-teller told you.  You can please yourself what you
    believe."
</p>
<p>
    "I believe you, John," said his wife, humbly.
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Boxer's countenance cleared and he drew her on to his knee.
</p>
<p>
    "That's right," he said, cheerfully.  "So long as you believe in me I
    don't care what other people think.  And before I'm much older I'll find
    out how that old rascal got to know the names of the ships I was aboard.
    Seems to me somebody's been talking."

<h2>
    BLUNDELL'S IMPROVEMENT
</h2>
<p>
    Venia Turnbull in a quiet, unobtrusive fashion was enjoying herself.  The
    cool living-room at Turnbull's farm was a delightful contrast to the hot
    sunshine without, and the drowsy humming of bees floating in at the open
    window was charged with hints of slumber to the middle-aged.  From her
    seat by the window she watched with amused interest the efforts of her
    father&mdash;kept from his Sunday afternoon nap by the assiduous attentions of
    her two admirers&mdash;to maintain his politeness.
</p>
<p>
    "Father was so pleased to see you both come in," she said, softly; "it's
    very dull for him here of an afternoon with only me."
</p>

<!--IMAGE END-->
<p>
    "I can't imagine anybody being dull with only you," said Sergeant Dick
    Daly, turning a bold brown eye upon her.
</p>
<p>
    Mr. John Blundell scowled; this was the third time the sergeant had said
    the thing that he would have liked to say if he had thought of it.
</p>
<p>
    "I don't mind being dull," remarked Mr. Turnbull, casually.
</p>
<p>
    Neither gentleman made any comment.
</p>
<p>
    "I like it," pursued Mr. Turnbull, longingly; "always did, from a child."
</p>
<p>
    The two young men looked at each other; then they looked at Venia; the
    sergeant assumed an expression of careless ease, while John Blundell sat
    his chair like a human limpet.  Mr. Turnbull almost groaned as he
    remembered his tenacity.
</p>
<p>
    "The garden's looking very nice," he said, with a pathetic glance round.
</p>
<p>
    "Beautiful," assented the sergeant.  "I saw it yesterday."
</p>
<p>
    "Some o' the roses on that big bush have opened a bit more since then,"
    said the farmer.
</p>
<p>
    Sergeant Daly expressed his gratification, and said that he was not
    surprised.  It was only ten days since he had arrived in the village on a
    visit to a relative, but in that short space of time he had, to the great
    discomfort of Mr. Blundell, made himself wonderfully at home at Mr.
    Turnbull's.  To Venia he related strange adventures by sea and land, and
    on subjects of which he was sure the farmer knew nothing he was a perfect
    mine of information.  He began to talk in low tones to Venia, and the
    heart of Mr. Blundell sank within him as he noted her interest.  Their
    voices fell to a gentle murmur, and the sergeant's sleek, well-brushed
    head bent closer to that of his listener.  Relieved from his attentions,
    Mr. Turnbull fell asleep without more ado.
</p>
<p>
    Blundell sat neglected, the unwilling witness of a flirtation he was
    powerless to prevent.  Considering her limited opportunities, Miss
    Turnbull displayed a proficiency which astonished him.  Even the sergeant
    was amazed, and suspected her of long practice.
</p>
<p>
    "I wonder whether it is very hot outside?" she said, at last, rising and
    looking out of the window.
</p>
<p>
    "Only pleasantly warm," said the sergeant.  "It would be nice down by the
    water."
</p>
<p>
    "I'm afraid of disturbing father by our talk," said the considerate
    daughter.  "You might tell him we've gone for a little stroll when he
    wakes," she added, turning to Blundell.
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Blundell, who had risen with the idea of acting the humble but, in
    his opinion, highly necessary part of chaperon, sat down again and
    watched blankly from the window until they were out of sight.  He was
    half inclined to think that the exigencies of the case warranted him in
    arousing the farmer at once.
</p>
<p>
    It was an hour later when the farmer awoke, to find himself alone with
    Mr. Blundell, a state of affairs for which he strove with some
    pertinacity to make that aggrieved gentleman responsible.
</p>
<p>
    "Why didn't you go with them?" he demanded.  "Because I wasn't asked,"
    replied the other.
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Turnbull sat up in his chair and eyed him disdainfully.  "For a
    great, big chap like you are, John Blundell," he exclaimed, "it's
    surprising what a little pluck you've got."
</p>
<p>
    "I don't want to go where I'm not wanted," retorted Mr. Blundell.
</p>
<p>
    "That's where you make a mistake," said the other, regarding him
    severely; "girls like a masterful man, and, instead of getting your own
    way, you sit down quietly and do as you're told, like a tame&mdash;tame&mdash;"
</p>
<p>
    "Tame what?" inquired Mr. Blundell, resentfully.
</p>
<p>
    "I don't know," said the other, frankly; "the tamest thing you can think
    of.  There's Daly laughing in his sleeve at you, and talking to Venia
    about Waterloo and the Crimea as though he'd been there.  I thought it
    was pretty near settled between you."
</p>
<p>
    "So did I," said Mr. Blundell.
</p>
<p>
    "You're a big man, John," said the other, "but you're slow.  You're all
    muscle and no head."
</p>
<p>
    "I think of things afterward," said Blundell, humbly; "generally after I
    get to bed."
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Turnbull sniffed, and took a turn up and down the room; then he
    closed the door and came toward his friend again.
</p>
<p>
    "I dare say you're surprised at me being so anxious to get rid of Venia,"
    he said, slowly, "but the fact is I'm thinking of marrying again myself."
</p>
<p>
    "You!" said the startled Mr. Blundell.
</p>
<p>
    "Yes, me," said the other, somewhat sharply.  "But she won't marry so
    long as Venia is at home.  It's a secret, because if Venia got to hear of
    it she'd keep single to prevent it.  She's just that sort of girl."
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Blundell coughed, but did not deny it.  "Who is it?"  he inquired.
</p>
<p>
    "Miss Sippet," was the reply.  "She couldn't hold her own for half an
    hour against Venia."
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Blundell, a great stickler for accuracy, reduced the time to five
    minutes.
</p>
<p>
    "And now," said the aggrieved Mr. Turnbull, "now, so far as I can see,
    she's struck with Daly.  If she has him it'll be years and years before
    they can marry.  She seems crazy about heroes.  She was talking to me the
    other night about them.  Not to put too fine a point on it, she was
    talking about you."
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Blundell blushed with pleased surprise.
</p>
<p>
    "Said you were not a hero," explained Mr. Turnbull.  "Of course, I stuck
    up for you.  I said you'd got too much sense to go putting your life into
    danger.  I said you were a very careful man, and I told her how
    particular you was about damp sheets.  Your housekeeper told me."
</p>
<p>
    "It's all nonsense," said Blundell, with a fiery face.  "I'll send that
    old fool packing if she can't keep her tongue quiet."
</p>
<p>
    "It's very sensible of you, John," said Mr. Turnbull, "and a sensible
    girl would appreciate it.  Instead of that, she only sniffed when I told
    her how careful you always were to wear flannel next to your skin.  She
    said she liked dare-devils."
</p>
<p>
    "I suppose she thinks Daly is a dare-devil," said the offended Mr.
    Blundell.  "And I wish people wouldn't talk about me and my skin.  Why
    can't they mind their own business?"
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Turnbull eyed him indignantly, and then, sitting in a very upright
    position, slowly filled his pipe, and declining a proffered match rose
    and took one from the mantel-piece.
</p>
<p>
    "I was doing the best I could for you," he said, staring hard at the
    ingrate.  "I was trying to make Venia see what a careful husband you
    would make.  Miss Sippet herself is most particular about such things&mdash;
    and Venia seemed to think something of it, because she asked me whether
    you used a warming-pan."
</p>
<a name="image-13"><!--IMG--></a>

<img src="images/013.jpg" height="609" width="579"
alt="'she Asked Me Whether You Used a Warming-pan.'

</center>
<!--IMAGE END-->
<p>
    Mr. Blundell got up from his chair and, without going through the
    formality of bidding his host good-by, quitted the room and closed the
    door violently behind him.  He was red with rage, and he brooded darkly
    as he made his way home on the folly of carrying on the traditions of a
    devoted mother without thinking for himself.
</p>
<p>
    For the next two or three days, to Venia's secret concern, he failed to
    put in an appearance at the farm&mdash;a fact which made flirtation with the
    sergeant a somewhat uninteresting business.  Her sole recompense was the
    dismay of her father, and for his benefit she dwelt upon the advantages
    of the Army in a manner that would have made the fortune of a recruiting-sergeant.
</p>
<p>
    "She's just crazy after the soldiers," he said to Mr. Blundell, whom he
    was trying to spur on to a desperate effort.  "I've been watching her
    close, and I can see what it is now; she's romantic.  You're too slow and
    ordinary for her.  She wants somebody more dazzling.  She told Daly only
    yesterday afternoon that she loved heroes.  Told it to him to his face.
    I sat there and heard her.  It's a pity you ain't a hero, John."
</p>
<p>
    "Yes," said Mr. Blundell; "then, if I was, I expect she'd like something
    else."
</p>
<p>
    The other shook his head.  "If you could only do something daring," he
    murmured; "half-kill some-body, or save somebody's life, and let her see
    you do it.  Couldn't you dive off the quay and save some-body's life from
    drowning?"
</p>
<p>
    "Yes, I could," said Blundell, "if somebody would only tumble in."
</p>
<p>
    "You might pretend that you thought you saw somebody drowning," suggested
    Mr. Turnbull.
</p>
<p>
    "And be laughed at," said Mr. Blundell, who knew his Venia by heart.
</p>
<p>
    "You always seem to be able to think of objections," complained Mr.
    Turnbull; "I've noticed that in you before."
</p>
<p>
    "I'd go in fast enough if there was anybody there," said Blundell.  "I'm
    not much of a swimmer, but&mdash;"
</p>
<p>
    "All the better," interrupted the other; "that would make it all the more
    daring."
</p>
<p>
    "And I don't much care if I'm drowned," pursued the younger man,
    gloomily.
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Turnbull thrust his hands in his pockets and took a turn or two up
    and down the room.  His brows were knitted and his lips pursed.  In the
    presence of this mental stress Mr. Blundell preserved a respectful
    silence.
</p>
<p>
    "We'll all four go for a walk on the quay on Sunday afternoon," said Mr.
    Turnbull, at last.
</p>
<p>
    "On the chance?" inquired his staring friend.
</p>
<p>
    "On the chance," assented the other; "it's just possible Daly might fall
    in."
</p>
<p>
    "He might if we walked up and down five million times," said Blundell,
    unpleasantly.
</p>
<p>
    "He might if we walked up and down three or four times," said Mr.
    Turnbull, "especially if you happened to stumble."
</p>
<p>
    "I never stumble," said the matter-of-fact Mr. Blundell.  "I don't know
    anybody more sure-footed than I am."
</p>
<p>
    "Or thick-headed," added the exasperated Mr. Turnbull.
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Blundell regarded him patiently; he had a strong suspicion that his
    friend had been drinking.
</p>
<p>
    "Stumbling," said Mr. Turnbull, conquering his annoyance with an effort
    "stumbling is a thing that might happen to anybody.  You trip your foot
    against a stone and lurch up against Daly; he tumbles overboard, and you
    off with your jacket and dive in off the quay after him.  He can't swim a
    stroke."
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Blundell caught his breath and gazed at him in speechless amaze.
</p>
<p>
    "There's sure to be several people on the quay if it's a fine afternoon,"
    continued his instructor.  "You'll have half Dunchurch round you,
    praising you and patting you on the back&mdash;all in front of Venia, mind
    you.  It'll be put in all the papers and you'll get a medal."
</p>
<p>
    "And suppose we are both drowned?" said Mr. Blundell, soberly.
</p>
<p>
    "Drowned?  Fiddlesticks!"  said Mr. Turnbull.  "However, please
    yourself.  If you're afraid&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>
<p>
    "I'll do it," said Blundell, decidedly.
</p>
<p>
    "And mind," said the other, "don't do it as if it's as easy as kissing
    your fingers; be half-drowned yourself, or at least pretend to be.  And
    when you're on the quay take your time about coming round.  Be longer
    than Daly is; you don't want him to get all the pity."
</p>
<p>
    "All right," said the other.
</p>
<p>
    "After a time you can open your eyes," went on his instructor; "then, if
    I were you, I should say, 'Good-bye, Venia,' and close 'em again.  Work
    it up affecting, and send messages to your aunts."
</p>
<p>
    "It sounds all right," said Blundell.
</p>
<p>
    "It is all right," said Mr. Turnbull.  "That's just the bare idea I've
    given you.  It's for you to improve upon it.  You've got two days to
    think about it."
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Blundell thanked him, and for the next two days thought of little
    else.  Being a careful man he made his will, and it was in a
    comparatively cheerful frame of mind that he made his way on Sunday
    afternoon to Mr. Turnbull's.
</p>
<p>
    The sergeant was already there conversing in low tones with Venia by the
    window, while Mr. Turnbull, sitting opposite in an oaken armchair,
    regarded him with an expression which would have shocked Iago.
</p>
<p>
    "We were just thinking of having a blow down by the water," he said, as
    Blundell entered.
</p>
<p>
    "What! a hot day like this?"  said Venia.
</p>
<p>
    "I was just thinking how beautifully cool it is in here," said the
    sergeant, who was hoping for a repetition of the previous Sunday's
    performance.
</p>
<p>
    "It's cooler outside," said Mr. Turnbull, with a wilful ignoring of
    facts; "much cooler when you get used to it."
</p>
<p>
    He led the way with Blundell, and Venia and the sergeant, keeping as much
    as possible in the shade of the dust-powdered hedges, followed.  The sun
    was blazing in the sky, and scarce half-a-dozen people were to be seen on
    the little curved quay which constituted the usual Sunday afternoon
    promenade.  The water, a dozen feet below, lapped cool and green against
    the stone sides.
</p>
<p>
    At the extreme end of the quay, underneath the lantern, they all stopped,
    ostensibly to admire a full-rigged ship sailing slowly by in the
    distance, but really to effect the change of partners necessary to the
    after-noon's business.  The change gave Mr. Turnbull some trouble ere it
    was effected, but he was successful at last, and, walking behind the two
    young men, waited somewhat nervously for developments.
</p>
<p>
    Twice they paraded the length of the quay and nothing happened.  The ship
    was still visible, and, the sergeant halting to gaze at it, the company
    lost their formation, and he led the complaisant Venia off from beneath
    her father's very nose.
</p>
<p>
    "You're a pretty manager, you are, John Blundell," said the incensed Mr.
    Turnbull.
</p>
<p>
    "I know what I'm about," said Blundell, slowly.
</p>
<p>
    "Well, why don't you do it?" demanded the other.  "I suppose you are
    going to wait until there are more people about, and then perhaps some of
    them will see you push him over."
</p>
<p>
    "It isn't that," said Blundell, slowly, "but you told me to improve on
    your plan, you know, and I've been thinking out improvements."
</p>
<p>
    "Well?" said the other.
</p>
<p>
    "It doesn't seem much good saving Daly," said Blundell; "that's what I've
    been thinking.  He would be in as much danger as I should, and he'd get
    as much sympathy; perhaps more."
</p>
<p>
    "Do you mean to tell me that you are backing out of it?"  demanded Mr.
    Turnbull.
</p>
<p>
    "No," said Blundell, slowly, "but it would be much better if I saved
    somebody else.  I don't want Daly to be pitied."
</p>
<p>
    "Bah!  you are backing out of it," said the irritated Mr. Turnbull.
    "You're afraid of a little cold water."
</p>

alt="'bah! You Are Backing out of It,' Said the Irritated Mr.

">
</center>
<!--IMAGE END-->
<p>
    "No, I'm not," said Blundell; "but it would be better in every way to
    save somebody else.  She'll see Daly standing there doing nothing, while
    I am struggling for my life.  I've thought it all out very carefully.  I
    know I'm not quick, but I'm sure, and when I make up my mind to do a
    thing, I do it.  You ought to know that."
</p>
<p>
    "That's all very well," said the other; "but who else is there to push
    in?"
</p>
<p>
    "That's all right," said Blundell, vaguely.  "Don't you worry about that;
    I shall find somebody."
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Turnbull turned and cast a speculative eye along the quay.  As a
    rule, he had great confidence in Blundell's determination, but on this
    occasion he had his doubts.
</p>
<p>
    "Well, it's a riddle to me," he said, slowly.  "I give it up.  It seems&mdash;
    Halloa!  Good heavens, be careful.  You nearly had me in then."
</p>
<p>
    "Did I?"  said Blundell, thickly.  "I'm very sorry."
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Turnbull, angry at such carelessness, accepted the apology in a
    grudging spirit and trudged along in silence.  Then he started nervously
    as a monstrous and unworthy suspicion occurred to him.  It was an
    incredible thing to suppose, but at the same time he felt that there was
    nothing like being on the safe side, and in tones not quite free from
    significance he intimated his desire of changing places with his awkward
    friend.
</p>
<p>
    "It's all right," said Blundell, soothingly.
</p>
<p>
    "I know it is," said Mr. Turnbull, regarding him fixedly; "but I prefer
    this side.  You very near had me over just now."
</p>
<p>
    "I staggered," said Mr. Blundell.
</p>
<p>
    "Another inch and I should have been overboard," said Mr. Turnbull, with
    a shudder.  "That would have been a nice how d'ye do."
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Blundell coughed and looked seaward.  "Accidents will happen," he
    murmured.
</p>
<p>
    They reached the end of the quay again and stood talking, and when they
    turned once more the sergeant was surprised and gratified at the ease
    with which he bore off Venia.  Mr. Turnbull and Blundell followed some
    little way behind, and the former gentleman's suspicions were somewhat
    lulled by finding that his friend made no attempt to take the inside
    place.  He looked about him with interest for a likely victim, but in
    vain.
</p>
<p>
    "What are you looking at?" he demanded, impatiently, as Blundell suddenly
    came to a stop and gazed curiously into the harbour.
</p>
<p>
    "Jelly-fish," said the other, briefly.  "I never saw such a monster.  It
    must be a yard across."
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Turnbull stopped, but could see nothing, and even when Blundell
    pointed it out with his finger he had no better success.  He stepped
    forward a pace, and his suspicions returned with renewed vigour as a hand
    was laid caressingly on his shoulder.  The next moment, with a wild
    shriek, he shot suddenly over the edge and disappeared.  Venia and the
    sergeant, turning hastily, were just in time to see the fountain which
    ensued on his immersion.

<p>
    "Oh, save him!"  cried Venia.

<p>
    The sergeant ran to the edge and gazed in helpless dismay as Mr. Turnbull
    came to the surface and disappeared again.  At the same moment Blundell,
    who had thrown off his coat, dived into the harbour and, rising rapidly
    to the surface, caught the fast-choking Mr. Turnbull by the collar.
</p>
<p>
    "Keep still," he cried, sharply, as the farmer tried to clutch him; "keep
    still or I'll let you go."
</p>
<p>
    "Help!"  choked the farmer, gazing up at the little knot of people which
    had collected on the quay.
</p>
<p>
    A stout fisherman who had not run for thirty years came along the edge of
    the quay at a shambling trot, with a coil of rope over his arm.  John
    Blundell saw him and, mindful of the farmer's warning about kissing of
    fingers, etc., raised his disengaged arm and took that frenzied gentleman
    below the surface again.  By the time they came up he was very glad for
    his own sake to catch the line skilfully thrown by the old fisherman and
    be drawn gently to the side.
</p>
<p>
    "I'll tow you to the steps," said the fisherman; "don't let go o' the
    line."
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Turnbull saw to that; he wound the rope round his wrist and began to
    regain his presence of mind as they were drawn steadily toward the steps.
    Willing hands drew them out of the water and helped them up on to the
    quay, where Mr. Turnbull, sitting in his own puddle, coughed up salt
    water and glared ferociously at the inanimate form of Mr. Blundell.
    Sergeant Daly and another man were rendering what they piously believed
    to be first aid to the apparently drowned, while the stout fisherman,
    with both hands to his mouth, was yelling in heart-rending accents for a
    barrel.
</p>
<p>
    "He&mdash;he&mdash;push&mdash;pushed me in," gasped the choking Mr. Turnbull.
</p>
<p>
    Nobody paid any attention to him; even Venia, seeing that he was safe,
    was on her knees by the side of the unconscious Blundell.
</p>
<p>
    "He&mdash;he's shamming," bawled the neglected Mr. Turnbull.
</p>
<p>
    "Shame!" said somebody, without even looking round.
</p>
<p>
    "He pushed me in," repeated Mr. Turnbull.  "He pushed me in."
</p>
<p>
    "Oh, father," said Venia, with a scandalised glance at him, "how can
    you?"
</p>
<p>
    "Shame!"  said the bystanders, briefly, as they, watched anxiously for
    signs of returning life on the part of Mr. Blundell.  He lay still with
    his eyes closed, but his hearing was still acute, and the sounds of a
    rapidly approaching barrel trundled by a breathless Samaritan did him
    more good than anything.
</p>
<p>
    "Good-bye, Venia," he said, in a faint voice; "good-bye."
</p>
<p>
    Miss Turnbull sobbed and took his hand.
</p>
<p>
    "He's shamming," roared Mr. Turnbull, incensed beyond measure at the
    faithful manner in which Blundell was carrying out his instructions.  "He
    pushed me in."
</p>
<p>
    There was an angry murmur from the bystanders.  "Be reasonable, Mr.
    Turnbull," said the sergeant, somewhat sharply.
</p>
<p>
    "He nearly lost 'is life over you," said the stout fisherman.  "As plucky
    a thing as ever I see.  If I 'adn't ha' been 'andy with that there line
    you'd both ha' been drownded."
</p>
<p>
    "Give&mdash;my love&mdash;to everybody," said Blundell, faintly.  "Good-bye, Venia.
    Good-bye, Mr. Turnbull."
</p>
<p>
    "Where's that barrel?"  demanded the stout fisher-man, crisply.  "Going
    to be all night with it?  Now, two of you&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Blundell, with a great effort, and assisted by Venia and the
    sergeant, sat up.  He felt that he had made a good impression, and had no
    desire to spoil it by riding the barrel.  With one exception, everybody
    was regarding him with moist-eyed admiration.  The exception's eyes were,
    perhaps, the moistest of them all, but admiration had no place in them.
</p>
<p>
    "You're all being made fools of," he said, getting up and stamping.  "I
    tell you he pushed me over-board for the purpose."
</p>
<p>
    "Oh, father!  how can you?"  demanded Venia, angrily.  "He saved your
    life."
</p>
<p>
    "He pushed me in," repeated the farmer.  "Told me to look at a jelly-fish
    and pushed me in."
</p>
<p>
    "What for?" inquired Sergeant Daly.
</p>
<p>
    "Because&mdash;" said Mr. Turnbull.  He looked at the unconscious sergeant,
    and the words on his lips died away in an inarticulate growl.
</p>
<p>
    "What for?"  pursued the sergeant, in triumph.  "Be reasonable, Mr.
    Turnbull.  Where's the reason in pushing you overboard and then nearly
    losing his life saving you?  That would be a fool's trick.  It was as
    fine a thing as ever I saw."
</p>
<p>
    "What you 'ad, Mr. Turnbull," said the stout fisherman, tapping him on
    the arm, "was a little touch o' the sun."
</p>
<p>
    "What felt to you like a push," said another man, "and over you went."
</p>
<p>
    "As easy as easy," said a third.
</p>
<p>
    "You're red in the face now," said the stout fisherman, regarding him
    critically, "and your eyes are starting.  You take my advice and get 'ome
    and get to bed, and the first thing you'll do when you get your senses
    back will be to go round and thank Mr. Blundell for all 'e's done for
    you."

<p>
    Mr. Turnbull looked at them, and the circle of intelligent faces grew
    misty before his angry eyes.  One man, ignoring his sodden condition,
    recommended a wet handkerchief tied round his brow.
</p>
<p>
    "I don't want any thanks, Mr. Turnbull," said Blundell, feebly, as he was
    assisted to his feet.  "I'd do as much for you again."
</p>
<p>
    The stout fisherman patted him admiringly on the back, and Mr. Turnbull
    felt like a prophet beholding a realised vision as the spectators
    clustered round Mr. Blundell and followed their friends' example.
    Tenderly but firmly they led the hero in triumph up the quay toward home,
    shouting out eulogistic descriptions of his valour to curious neighbours
    as they passed.  Mr. Turnbull, churlishly keeping his distance in the
    rear of the procession, received in grim silence the congratulations of
    his friends.
</p>
<p>
    The extraordinary hallucination caused by the sun-stroke lasted with him
    for over a week, but at the end of that time his mind cleared and he saw
    things in the same light as reasonable folk.  Venia was the first to
    congratulate him upon his recovery; but his extraordinary behaviour in
    proposing to Miss Sippet the very day on which she herself became Mrs.
    Blundell convinced her that his recovery was only partial.

<h2>
    BILL'S LAPSE
</h2>
<p>
    Strength and good-nature&mdash;said the night-watchman, musingly, as he felt
    his biceps&mdash;strength and good-nature always go together.  Sometimes you
    find a strong man who is not good-natured, but then, as everybody he
    comes in contack with is, it comes to the same thing.
</p>
<p>
    The strongest and kindest-'earted man I ever come across was a man o' the
    name of Bill Burton, a ship-mate of Ginger Dick's.  For that matter 'e
    was a shipmate o' Peter Russet's and old Sam Small's too.  Not over and
    above tall; just about my height, his arms was like another man's legs
    for size, and 'is chest and his back and shoulders might ha' been made
    for a giant.  And with all that he'd got a soft blue eye like a gal's
    (blue's my favourite colour for gals' eyes), and a nice, soft, curly
    brown beard.  He was an A.B., too, and that showed 'ow good-natured he
    was, to pick up with firemen.
</p>
<p>
    He got so fond of 'em that when they was all paid off from the <i>Ocean
    King</i> he asked to be allowed to join them in taking a room ashore.  It
    pleased every-body, four coming cheaper than three, and Bill being that
    good-tempered that 'e'd put up with anything, and when any of the three
    quarrelled he used to act the part of peacemaker.

<p>
    The only thing about 'im that they didn't like was that 'e was a
    teetotaler.  He'd go into public-'ouses with 'em, but he wouldn't drink;
    leastways, that is to say, he wouldn't drink beer, and Ginger used to say
    that it made 'im feel uncomfortable to see Bill put away a bottle o'
    lemonade every time they 'ad a drink.  One night arter 'e had 'ad
    seventeen bottles he could 'ardly got home, and Peter Russet, who knew a
    lot about pills and such-like, pointed out to 'im 'ow bad it was for his
    constitushon.  He proved that the lemonade would eat away the coats o'
    Bill's stomach, and that if 'e kept on 'e might drop down dead at any
    moment.
</p>
<p>
    That frightened Bill a bit, and the next night, instead of 'aving
    lemonade, 'e had five bottles o' stone ginger-beer, six of different
    kinds of teetotal beer, three of soda-water, and two cups of coffee.  I'm
    not counting the drink he 'ad at the chemist's shop arterward, because he
    took that as medicine, but he was so queer in 'is inside next morning
    that 'e began to be afraid he'd 'ave to give up drink altogether.
</p>
<p>
    He went without the next night, but 'e was such a generous man that 'e
    would pay every fourth time, and there was no pleasure to the other chaps
    to see 'im pay and 'ave nothing out of it.  It spoilt their evening, and
    owing to 'aving only about 'arf wot they was accustomed to they all got
    up very disagreeable next morning.
</p>
<p>
    "Why not take just a little beer, Bill?" asks Ginger.
</p>
<p>
    Bill 'ung his 'ead and looked a bit silly.  "I'd rather not, mate," he
    ses, at last.  "I've been teetotal for eleven months now."
</p>
<p>
    "Think of your 'ealth, Bill," ses Peter Russet; "your 'ealth is more
    important than the pledge.  Wot made you take it?"
</p>
<p>
    Bill coughed.  "I 'ad reasons," he ses, slowly.  "A mate o' mine wished
    me to."
</p>
<p>
    "He ought to ha' known better," ses Sam.  "He 'ad 'is reasons," ses Bill.
</p>
<p>
    "Well, all I can say is, Bill," ses Ginger, "all I can say is, it's very
    disobligin' of you."
</p>
<p>
    "Disobligin'?" ses Bill, with a start; "don't say that, mate."
</p>
<p>
    "I must say it," ses Ginger, speaking very firm.
</p>
<p>
    "You needn't take a lot, Bill," ses Sam; "nobody wants you to do that.
    Just drink in moderation, same as wot we do."
</p>
<p>
    "It gets into my 'ead," ses Bill, at last.
</p>
<p>
    "Well, and wot of it?" ses Ginger; "it gets into everybody's 'ead
    occasionally.  Why, one night old Sam 'ere went up behind a policeman and
    tickled 'im under the arms; didn't you, Sam?"
</p>
<p>
    "I did nothing o' the kind," ses Sam, firing up.
</p>
<p>
    "Well, you was fined ten bob for it next morning, that's all I know," ses
    Ginger.
</p>
<p>
    "I was fined ten bob for punching 'im," ses old Sam, very wild.  "I never
    tickled a policeman in my life.  I never thought o' such a thing.  I'd no
    more tickle a policeman than I'd fly.  Anybody that ses I did is a liar.
    Why should I?  Where does the sense come in?  Wot should I want to do it
    for?"
</p>
<p>
    "All right, Sam," ses Ginger, sticking 'is fingers in 'is ears, "you
    didn't, then."
</p>
<p>
    "No, I didn't," ses Sam, "and don't you forget it.  This ain't the fust
    time you've told that lie about me.  I can take a joke with any man; but
    anybody that goes and ses I tickled&mdash;"
</p>
<p>
    "All right," ses Ginger and Peter Russet together.  "You'll 'ave tickled
    policeman on the brain if you ain't careful, Sam," ses Peter.
</p>
<p>
    Old Sam sat down growling, and Ginger Dick turned to Bill agin.  "It gets
    into everybody's 'ead at times," he ses, "and where's the 'arm?  It's wot
    it was meant for."
</p>
<p>
    Bill shook his 'ead, but when Ginger called 'im disobligin' agin he gave
    way and he broke the pledge that very evening with a pint o' six 'arf.
</p>
<p>
    Ginger was surprised to see the way 'e took his liquor.  Arter three or
    four pints he'd expected to see 'im turn a bit silly, or sing, or do
    something o' the kind, but Bill kept on as if 'e was drinking water.
</p>
<p>
    "Think of the 'armless pleasure you've been losing all these months,
    Bill," ses Ginger, smiling at him.
</p>
<p>
    Bill said it wouldn't bear thinking of, and, the next place they came to
    he said some rather 'ard things of the man who'd persuaded 'im to take
    the pledge.  He 'ad two or three more there, and then they began to see
    that it was beginning to have an effect on 'im.  The first one that
    noticed it was Ginger Dick.  Bill 'ad just lit 'is pipe, and as he threw
    the match down he ses: "I don't like these 'ere safety matches," he ses.
</p>
<p>
    "Don't you, Bill?" ses Ginger.  "I do, rather."
</p>
<p>
    "Oh, you do, do you?"  ses Bill, turning on 'im like lightning; "well,
    take that for contradictin'," he ses, an' he gave Ginger a smack that
    nearly knocked his 'ead off.
</p>
<p>
    It was so sudden that old Sam and Peter put their beer down and stared at
    each other as if they couldn't believe their eyes.  Then they stooped
    down and helped pore Ginger on to 'is legs agin and began to brush 'im
    down.
</p>
<p>
    "Never mind about 'im, mates," ses Bill, looking at Ginger very wicked.
    "P'r'aps he won't be so ready to give me 'is lip next time.  Let's come
    to another pub and enjoy ourselves."
</p>
<p>
    Sam and Peter followed 'im out like lambs, 'ardly daring to look over
    their shoulder at Ginger, who was staggering arter them some distance
    behind a 'olding a handerchief to 'is face.
</p>
<p>
    "It's your turn to pay, Sam," ses Bill, when they'd got inside the next
    place.  "Wot's it to be?  Give it a name."
</p>
<p>
    "Three 'arf pints o' four ale, miss," ses Sam, not because 'e was mean,
    but because it wasn't 'is turn.  "Three wot?" ses Bill, turning on 'im.
</p>
<p>
    "Three pots o' six ale, miss," ses Sam, in a hurry.
</p>
<p>
    "That wasn't wot you said afore," ses Bill.  "Take that," he ses, giving
    pore old Sam a wipe in the mouth and knocking 'im over a stool; "take
    that for your sauce."
</p>
<p>
    Peter Russet stood staring at Sam and wondering wot Bill ud be like when
    he'd 'ad a little more.  Sam picked hisself up arter a time and went
    outside to talk to Ginger about it, and then Bill put 'is arm round
    Peter's neck and began to cry a bit and say 'e was the only pal he'd got
    left in the world.  It was very awkward for Peter, and more awkward still
    when the barman came up and told 'im to take Bill outside.
</p>
<p>
    "Go on," he ses, "out with 'im."
</p>
<p>
    "He's all right," ses Peter, trembling; "we's the truest-'arted gentleman
    in London.  Ain't you, Bill?"
</p>
<p>
    Bill said he was, and 'e asked the barman to go and hide 'is face because
    it reminded 'im of a little dog 'e had 'ad once wot 'ad died.
</p>
<p>
    "You get outside afore you're hurt," ses the bar-man.
</p>
<p>
    Bill punched at 'im over the bar, and not being able to reach 'im threw
    Peter's pot o' beer at 'im.  There was a fearful to-do then, and the
    landlord jumped over the bar and stood in the doorway, whistling for the
    police.  Bill struck out right and left, and the men in the bar went down
    like skittles, Peter among them.  Then they got outside, and Bill, arter
    giving the landlord a thump in the back wot nearly made him swallow the
    whistle, jumped into a cab and pulled Peter Russet in arter 'im.

<p>
    "I'll talk to you by-and-by," he ses, as the cab drove off at a gallop;
    "there ain't room in this cab.  You wait, my lad, that's all.  You just
    wait till we get out, and I'll knock you silly."
</p>
<p>
    "Wot for, Bill?"  ses Peter, staring.
</p>
<p>
    "Don't you talk to me," roars Bill.  "If I choose to knock you about
    that's my business, ain't it?  Besides, you know very well."
</p>
<p>
    He wouldn't let Peter say another word, but coming to a quiet place near
    the docks he stopped the cab and pulling 'im out gave 'im such a dressing
    down that Peter thought 'is last hour 'ad arrived.  He let 'im go at
    last, and after first making him pay the cab-man took 'im along till they
    came to a public-'ouse and made 'im pay for drinks.
</p>
<p>
    They stayed there till nearly eleven o'clock, and then Bill set off home
    'olding the unfortunit Peter by the scruff o' the neck, and wondering out
    loud whether 'e ought to pay 'im a bit more or not.  Afore 'e could make
    up 'is mind, however, he turned sleepy, and, throwing 'imself down on the
    bed which was meant for the two of 'em, fell into a peaceful sleep.
</p>
<p>
    Sam and Ginger Dick came in a little while arterward, both badly marked
    where Bill 'ad hit them, and sat talking to Peter in whispers as to wot
    was to be done.  Ginger, who 'ad plenty of pluck, was for them all to set
    on to 'im, but Sam wouldn't 'ear of it, and as for Peter he was so sore
    he could 'ardly move.
</p>
<p>
    They all turned in to the other bed at last, 'arf afraid to move for fear
    of disturbing Bill, and when they woke up in the morning and see 'im
    sitting up in 'is bed they lay as still as mice.
</p>
<p>
    "Why, Ginger, old chap," ses Bill, with a 'earty smile, "wot are you all
    three in one bed for?"</p>
		
<p>
		"We was a bit cold," ses Ginger.
</p>
<p>
    "Cold?"  ses Bill.  "Wot, this weather?  We 'ad a bit of a spree last
    night, old man, didn't we?  My throat's as dry as a cinder."
</p>
<p>
    "It ain't my idea of a spree," ses Ginger, sitting up and looking at 'im.
</p>
<p>
    "Good 'eavens, Ginger!" ses Bill, starting back, "wotever 'ave you been
    a-doing to your face?  Have you been tumbling off of a 'bus?"
</p>
<p>
    Ginger couldn't answer; and Sam Small and Peter sat up in bed alongside
    of 'im, and Bill, getting as far back on 'is bed as he could, sat staring
    at their pore faces as if 'e was having a 'orrible dream.
</p>
<p>
    "And there's Sam," he ses.  "Where ever did you get that mouth, Sam?"
</p>
<p>
    "Same place as Ginger got 'is eye and pore Peter got 'is face," ses Sam,
    grinding his teeth.
</p>
<p>
    "You don't mean to tell me," ses Bill, in a sad voice&mdash;"you don't mean to
    tell me that I did it?"
</p>
<p>
    "You know well enough," ses Ginger.
</p>
<p>
    Bill looked at 'em, and 'is face got as long as a yard measure.
</p>
<p>
    "I'd 'oped I'd growed out of it, mates," he ses, at last, "but drink
    always takes me like that.  I can't keep a pal."
</p>
<p>
    "You surprise me," ses Ginger, sarcastic-like.  "Don't talk like that,
    Ginger," ses Bill, 'arf crying.
</p>
<p>
    "It ain't my fault; it's my weakness.  Wot did I do it for?"
</p>
<p>
    "I don't know," ses Ginger, "but you won't get the chance of doing it
    agin, I'll tell you that much."
</p>
<p>
    "I daresay I shall be better to-night, Ginger," ses Bill, very humble;
    "it don't always take me that way.
</p>
<p>
    "Well, we don't want you with us any more," ses old Sam, 'olding his 'ead
    very high.
</p>
<p>
    "You'll 'ave to go and get your beer by yourself, Bill," ses Peter
    Russet, feeling 'is bruises with the tips of 'is fingers.
</p>
<p>
    "But then I should be worse," ses Bill.  "I want cheerful company when
    I'm like that.  I should very likely come 'ome and 'arf kill you all in
    your beds.  You don't 'arf know what I'm like.  Last night was nothing,
    else I should 'ave remembered it."
</p>
<p>
    "Cheerful company?"  ses old Sam.  "'Ow do you think company's going to be
    cheerful when you're carrying on like that, Bill?  Why don't you go away
    and leave us alone?"
</p>
<p>
    "Because I've got a 'art," ses Bill.  "I can't chuck up pals in that
    free-and-easy way.  Once I take a liking to anybody I'd do anything for
    'em, and I've never met three chaps I like better than wot I do you.
    Three nicer, straight-forrad, free-'anded mates I've never met afore."
</p>
<p>
    "Why not take the pledge agin, Bill?"  ses Peter Russet.
</p>
<p>
    "No, mate," ses Bill, with a kind smile; "it's just a weakness, and I
    must try and grow out of it.  I'll tie a bit o' string round my little
    finger to-night as a re-minder."
</p>
<p>
    He got out of bed and began to wash 'is face, and Ginger Dick, who was
    doing a bit o' thinking, gave a whisper to Sam and Peter Russet.
</p>
<p>
    "All right, Bill, old man," he ses, getting out of bed and beginning to
    put his clothes on; "but first of all we'll try and find out 'ow the
    landlord is."
</p>
<p>
    "Landlord?" ses Bill, puffing and blowing in the basin.  "Wot landlord?"
</p>
<p>
    "Why, the one you bashed," ses Ginger, with a wink at the other two.  "He
    'adn't got 'is senses back when me and Sam came away."
</p>
<p>
    Bill gave a groan and sat on the bed while 'e dried himself, and Ginger
    told 'im 'ow he 'ad bent a quart pot on the landlord's 'ead, and 'ow the
    landlord 'ad been carried upstairs and the doctor sent for.  He began to
    tremble all over, and when Ginger said he'd go out and see 'ow the land
    lay 'e could 'ardly thank 'im enough.
</p>
<p>
    He stayed in the bedroom all day, with the blinds down, and wouldn't eat
    anything, and when Ginger looked in about eight o'clock to find out
    whether he 'ad gone, he found 'im sitting on the bed clean shaved, and
    'is face cut about all over where the razor 'ad slipped.
</p>
<p>
    Ginger was gone about two hours, and when 'e came back he looked so
    solemn that old Sam asked 'im whether he 'ad seen a ghost.  Ginger didn't
    answer 'im; he set down on the side o' the bed and sat thinking.
</p>
<p>
    "I s'pose&mdash;I s'pose it's nice and fresh in the streets this morning?"
    ses Bill, at last, in a trembling voice.
</p>
<p>
    Ginger started and looked at 'im.  "I didn't notice, mate," he ses.  Then
    'e got up and patted Bill on the back, very gentle, and sat down again.

<p>
    "Anything wrong, Ginger?"  asks Peter Russet, staring at 'im.
</p>
<p>
    "It's that landlord," ses Ginger; "there's straw down in the road
    outside, and they say that he's dying.  Pore old Bill don't know 'is own
    strength.  The best thing you can do, old pal, is to go as far away as
    you can, at once."
</p>
<p>
    "I shouldn't wait a minnit if it was me," ses old Sam.
</p>
<p>
    Bill groaned and hid 'is face in his 'ands, and then Peter Russet went
    and spoilt things by saying that the safest place for a murderer to 'ide
    in was London.  Bill gave a dreadful groan when 'e said murderer, but 'e
    up and agreed with Peter, and all Sam and Ginger Dick could do wouldn't
    make 'im alter his mind.  He said that he would shave off 'is beard and
    moustache, and when night came 'e would creep out and take a lodging
    somewhere right the other end of London.
</p>
<p>
    "It'll soon be dark," ses Ginger, "and your own brother wouldn't know you
    now, Bill.  Where d'you think of going?"
</p>
<p>
    Bill shook his 'ead.  "Nobody must know that, mate," he ses.  "I must go
    into hiding for as long as I can&mdash;as long as my money lasts; I've only
    got six pounds left."
</p>
<p>
    "That'll last a long time if you're careful," ses Ginger.
</p>
<p>
    "I want a lot more," ses Bill.  "I want you to take this silver ring as a
    keepsake, Ginger.  If I 'ad another six pounds or so I should feel much
    safer.  'Ow much 'ave you got, Ginger?"
</p>
<p>
    "Not much," ses Ginger, shaking his 'ead.
</p>
<p>
    "Lend it to me, mate," ses Bill, stretching out his 'and.  "You can easy
    get another ship.  Ah, I wish I was you; I'd be as 'appy as 'appy if I
    hadn't got a penny."
</p>
<p>
    "I'm very sorry, Bill," ses Ginger, trying to smile, "but I've already
    promised to lend it to a man wot we met this evening.  A promise is a
    promise, else I'd lend it to you with pleasure."
</p>
<p>
    "Would you let me be 'ung for the sake of a few pounds, Ginger?"  ses
    Bill, looking at 'im reproach-fully.  "I'm a desprit man, Ginger, and I
    must 'ave that money."
</p>
<p>
    Afore pore Ginger could move he suddenly clapped 'is hand over 'is mouth
    and flung 'im on the bed.  Ginger was like a child in 'is hands, although
    he struggled like a madman, and in five minutes 'e was laying there with
    a towel tied round his mouth and 'is arms and legs tied up with the cord
    off of Sam's chest.
</p>
<p>
    "I'm very sorry, Ginger," ses Bill, as 'e took a little over eight pounds
    out of Ginger's pocket.  "I'll pay you back one o' these days, if I can.
    If you'd got a rope round your neck same as I 'ave you'd do the same as
    I've done."
</p>
<p>
    He lifted up the bedclothes and put Ginger inside and tucked 'im up.
    Ginger's face was red with passion and 'is eyes starting out of his 'ead.
</p>
<p>
    "Eight and six is fifteen," ses Bill, and just then he 'eard somebody
    coming up the stairs.  Ginger 'eard it, too, and as Peter Russet came
    into the room 'e tried all 'e could to attract 'is attention by rolling
    'is 'ead from side to side.
</p>
<p>
    "Why, 'as Ginger gone to bed?" ses Peter.  "Wot's up, Ginger?"
</p>
<p>
    "He's all right," ses Bill; "just a bit of a 'eadache."
</p>
<p>
    Peter stood staring at the bed, and then 'e pulled the clothes off and
    saw pore Ginger all tied up, and making awful eyes at 'im to undo him.
</p>
<p>
    "I 'ad to do it, Peter," ses Bill.  "I wanted some more money to escape
    with, and 'e wouldn't lend it to me.  I 'aven't got as much as I want
    now.  You just came in in the nick of time.  Another minute and you'd ha'
    missed me.  'Ow much 'ave you got?"
</p>
<p>
    "Ah, I wish I could lend you some, Bill," ses Peter Russet, turning pale,
    "but I've 'ad my pocket picked; that's wot I came back for, to get some
    from Ginger."
</p>
<p>
    Bill didn't say a word.
</p>
<p>
    "You see 'ow it is, Bill," ses Peter, edging back toward the door; "three
    men laid 'old of me and took every farthing I'd got."
</p>
<p>
    "Well, I can't rob you, then," ses Bill, catching 'old of 'im.
    "Whoever's money this is," he ses, pulling a handful out o' Peter's
    pocket, "it can't be yours.  Now, if you make another sound I'll knock
    your 'ead off afore I tie you up."
</p>
<p>
    "Don't tie me up, Bill," ses Peter, struggling.
</p>
<p>
    "I can't trust you," ses Bill, dragging 'im over to the washstand and
    taking up the other towel; "turn round."
</p>
<p>
    Peter was a much easier job than Ginger Dick, and arter Bill 'ad done 'im
    'e put 'im in alongside o' Ginger and covered 'em up, arter first tying
    both the gags round with some string to prevent 'em slipping.
</p>
<p>
    "Mind, I've only borrowed it," he ses, standing by the side o' the bed;
    "but I must say, mates, I'm disappointed in both of you.  If either of
    you 'ad 'ad the misfortune wot I've 'ad, I'd have sold the clothes off my
    back to 'elp you.  And I wouldn't 'ave waited to be asked neither."
</p>
<p>
    He stood there for a minute very sorrowful, and then 'e patted both their
    'eads and went downstairs.  Ginger and Peter lay listening for a bit, and
    then they turned their pore bound-up faces to each other and tried to
    talk with their eyes.
</p>
<p>
    Then Ginger began to wriggle and try and twist the cords off, but 'e
    might as well 'ave tried to wriggle out of 'is skin.  The worst of it was
    they couldn't make known their intentions to each other, and when Peter
    Russet leaned over 'im and tried to work 'is gag off by rubbing it up
    agin 'is nose, Ginger pretty near went crazy with temper.  He banged
    Peter with his 'ead, and Peter banged back, and they kept it up till
    they'd both got splitting 'eadaches, and at last they gave up in despair
    and lay in the darkness waiting for Sam.
</p>
<p>
    And all this time Sam was sitting in the Red Lion, waiting for them.  He
    sat there quite patient till twelve o'clock and then walked slowly 'ome,
    wondering wot 'ad happened and whether Bill had gone.
</p>
<p>
    Ginger was the fust to 'ear 'is foot on the stairs, and as he came into
    the room, in the darkness, him an' Peter Russet started shaking their bed
    in a way that scared old Sam nearly to death.  He thought it was Bill
    carrying on agin, and 'e was out o' that door and 'arf-way downstairs
    afore he stopped to take breath.  He stood there trembling for about ten
    minutes, and then, as nothing 'appened, he walked slowly upstairs agin on
    tiptoe, and as soon as they heard the door creak Peter and Ginger made
    that bed do everything but speak.
</p>
<p>
    "Is that you, Bill?"  ses old Sam, in a shaky voice, and standing ready
    to dash downstairs agin.
</p>
<p>
    There was no answer except for the bed, and Sam didn't know whether Bill
    was dying or whether 'e 'ad got delirium trimmings.  All 'e did know was
    that 'e wasn't going to sleep in that room.  He shut the door gently and
    went downstairs agin, feeling in 'is pocket for a match, and, not finding
    one, 'e picked out the softest stair 'e could find and, leaning his 'ead
    agin the banisters, went to sleep.

<p>
    It was about six o'clock when 'e woke up, and broad daylight.  He was
    stiff and sore all over, and feeling braver in the light 'e stepped
    softly upstairs and opened the door.  Peter and Ginger was waiting for
    'im, and as he peeped in 'e saw two things sitting up in bed with their
    'air standing up all over like mops and their faces tied up with
    bandages.  He was that startled 'e nearly screamed, and then 'e stepped
    into the room and stared at 'em as if he couldn't believe 'is eyes.
</p>
<p>
    "Is that you, Ginger?" he ses.  "Wot d'ye mean by making sights of
    yourselves like that?  'Ave you took leave of your senses?"
</p>
<p>
    Ginger and Peter shook their 'eads and rolled their eyes, and then Sam
    see wot was the matter with 'em.  Fust thing 'e did was to pull out 'is
    knife and cut Ginger's gag off, and the fust thing Ginger did was to call
    'im every name 'e could lay his tongue to.
</p>
<p>
    "You wait a moment," he screams, 'arf crying with rage.  "You wait till I
    get my 'ands loose and I'll pull you to pieces.  The idea o' leaving us
    like this all night, you old crocodile.  I 'eard you come in.  I'll pay
    you."
</p>
<p>
    Sam didn't answer 'im.  He cut off Peter Russet's gag, and Peter Russet
    called 'im 'arf a score o' names without taking breath.
</p>
<p>
    "And when Ginger's finished I'll 'ave a go at you," he ses.  "Cut off
    these lines."
</p>
<p>
    "At once, d'ye hear?"  ses Ginger.  "Oh, you wait till I get my 'ands on
    you."
</p>
<p>
    Sam didn't answer 'em; he shut up 'is knife with a click and then 'e sat
    at the foot o' the bed on Ginger's feet and looked at 'em.  It wasn't the
    fust time they'd been rude to 'im, but as a rule he'd 'ad to put up with
    it.  He sat and listened while Ginger swore 'imself faint.
</p>
<p>
    "That'll do," he ses, at last; "another word and I shall put the
    bedclothes over your 'ead.  Afore I do anything more I want to know wot
    it's all about."
</p>
<p>
    Peter told 'im, arter fust calling 'im some more names, because Ginger
    was past it, and when 'e'd finished old Sam said 'ow surprised he was
    at them for letting Bill do it, and told 'em how they ought to 'ave
    prevented it.  He sat there talking as though 'e enjoyed the sound of 'is
    own voice, and he told Peter and Ginger all their faults and said wot
    sorrow it caused their friends.  Twice he 'ad to throw the bedclothes
    over their 'eads because o' the noise they was making.

<p>
    "<i>Are you going&mdash;to undo&mdash;us?</i>"  ses Ginger, at last.
</p>
<p>
    "No, Ginger," ses old Sam; "in justice to myself I couldn't do it.  Arter
    wot you've said&mdash;and arter wot I've said&mdash;my life wouldn't be safe.
    Besides which, you'd want to go shares in my money."
</p>
<p>
    He took up 'is chest and marched downstairs with it, and about 'arf an
    hour arterward the landlady's 'usband came up and set 'em free.  As soon
    as they'd got the use of their legs back they started out to look for
    Sam, but they didn't find 'im for nearly a year, and as for Bill, they
    never set eyes on 'im again.

<h2>
    LAWYER QUINCE
</h2>
<p>
    Lawyer Quince, so called by his neighbours in Little Haven from his
    readiness at all times to place at their disposal the legal lore he had
    acquired from a few old books while following his useful occupation of
    making boots, sat in a kind of wooden hutch at the side of his cottage
    plying his trade.  The London coach had gone by in a cloud of dust some
    three hours before, and since then the wide village street had slumbered
    almost undisturbed in the sunshine.
</p>
<a name="image-22"><!--IMG--></a>

<!--IMAGE END-->
<p>
    Hearing footsteps and the sound of voices raised in dispute caused him to
    look up from his work.  Mr. Rose, of Holly Farm, Hogg, the miller, and
    one or two neighbours of lesser degree appeared to be in earnest debate
    over some point of unusual difficulty.
</p>
<p>
    Lawyer Quince took a pinch of snuff and bent to his work again.  Mr. Rose
    was one of the very few who openly questioned his legal knowledge, and
    his gibes concerning it were only too frequent.  Moreover, he had a taste
    for practical joking, which to a grave man was sometimes offensive.
</p>
<p>
    "Well, here he be," said Mr. Hogg to the farmer, as the group halted in
    front of the hutch.  "Now ask Lawyer Quince and see whether I ain't told
    you true.  I'm willing to abide by what he says."
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Quince put down his hammer and, brushing a little snuff from his
    coat, leaned back in his chair and eyed them with grave confidence.
</p>
<p>
    "It's like this," said the farmer.  "Young Pascoe has been hanging round
    after my girl Celia, though I told her she wasn't to have nothing to do
    with him.  Half an hour ago I was going to put my pony in its stable when
    I see a young man sitting there waiting."
</p>
<p>
    "Well?"  said Mr. Quince, after a pause.
</p>
<p>
    "He's there yet," said the farmer.  "I locked him in, and Hogg here says
    that I've got the right to keep him locked up there as long as I like.  I
    say it's agin the law, but Hogg he says no.  I say his folks would come
    and try to break open my stable, but Hogg says if they do I can have the
    law of 'em for damaging my property."
</p>
<p>
    "So you can," interposed Mr. Hogg, firmly.  "You see whether Lawyer
    Quince don't say I'm right."
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Quince frowned, and in order to think more deeply closed his eyes.
    Taking advantage of this three of his auditors, with remarkable
    unanimity, each closed one.
</p>
<p>
    "It's your stable," said Mr. Quince, opening his eyes and speaking with
    great deliberation, "and you have a right to lock it up when you like."
</p>
<p>
    "There you are," said Mr. Hogg; "what did I tell you?"
</p>
<p>
    "If anybody's there that's got no business there, that's his look-out,"
    continued Mr. Quince.  "You didn't induce him to go in?"
</p>
<p>
    "Certainly not," replied the farmer.
</p>
<p>
    "I told him he can keep him there as long as he likes," said the jubilant
    Mr. Hogg, "and pass him in bread and water through the winder; it's got
    bars to it."
</p>
<p>
    "Yes," said Mr. Quince, nodding, "he can do that.  As for his folks
    knocking the place about, if you like to tie up one or two of them nasty,
    savage dogs of yours to the stable, well, it's your stable, and you can
    fasten your dogs to it if you like.  And you've generally got a man about
    the yard."
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Hogg smacked his thigh in ecstasy.
</p>
<p>
    "But&mdash;" began the farmer.
</p>
<p>
    "That's the law," said the autocratic Mr. Quince, sharply.  "O' course,
    if you think you know more about it than I do, I've nothing more to say."
</p>
<p>
    "I don't want to do nothing I could get into trouble for," murmured Mr.
    Rose.
</p>
<p>
    "You can't get into trouble by doing as I tell you," said the shoemaker,
    impatiently.  "However, to be quite on the safe side, if I was in your
    place I should lose the key."
</p>
<p>
    "Lose the key?"  said the farmer, blankly.
</p>
<p>
    "Lose the key," repeated the shoemaker, his eyes watering with intense
    appreciation of his own resourcefulness.  "You can find it any time you
    want to, you know.  Keep him there till he promises to give up your
    daughter, and tell him that as soon as he does you'll have a hunt for the
    key."
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Rose regarded him with what the shoemaker easily understood to be
    speechless admiration.
</p>
<p>
    "I&mdash;I'm glad I came to you," said the farmer, at last.
</p>
<p>
    "You're welcome," said the shoemaker, loftily.  "I'm always ready to give
    advice to them as require it."
</p>
<p>
    "And good advice it is," said the smiling Mr. Hogg.  "Why don't you
    behave yourself, Joe Garnham?"  he demanded, turning fiercely on a
    listener.
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Garnham, whose eyes were watering with emotion, attempted to explain,
    but, becoming hysterical, thrust a huge red handkerchief to his mouth and
    was led away by a friend.  Mr. Quince regarded his departure with mild
    disdain.
</p>
<p>
    "Little things please little minds," he remarked.
</p>
<p>
    "So they do," said Mr. Hogg.  "I never thought&mdash;What's the matter with
    you, George Askew?"
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Askew, turning his back on him, threw up his hands with a helpless
    gesture and followed in the wake of Mr. Garnham.  Mr. Hogg appeared to be
    about to apologise, and then suddenly altering his mind made a hasty and
    unceremonious exit, accompanied by the farmer.
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Quince raised his eyebrows and then, after a long and meditative
    pinch of snuff, resumed his work.  The sun went down and the light faded
    slowly; distant voices sounded close on the still evening air, snatches
    of hoarse laughter jarred upon his ears.  It was clear that the story of
    the imprisoned swain was giving pleasure to Little Haven.
</p>
<p>
    He rose at last from his chair and, stretching his long, gaunt frame,
    removed his leather apron, and after a wash at the pump went into the
    house.  Supper was laid, and he gazed with approval on the home-made
    sausage rolls, the piece of cold pork, and the cheese which awaited his
    onslaught.
</p>
<p>
    "We won't wait for Ned," said Mrs. Quince, as she brought in a jug of ale
    and placed it by her husband's elbow.
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Quince nodded and filled his glass.
</p>
<p>
    "You've been giving more advice, I hear," said Mrs. Quince.
</p>
<p>
    Her husband, who was very busy, nodded again.
</p>
<p>
    "It wouldn't make no difference to young Pascoe's chance, anyway," said
    Mrs. Quince, thoughtfully.
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Quince continued his labours.  "Why?"  he inquired, at last.
</p>
<p>
    His wife smiled and tossed her head.
</p>
<p>
    "Young Pascoe's no chance against our Ned," she said, swelling with
    maternal pride.
</p>
<p>
    "Eh?"  said the shoemaker, laying down his knife and fork.  "Our Ned?"
</p>
<p>
    "They are as fond of each other as they can be," said Mrs. Quince,
    "though I don't suppose Farmer Rose'll care for it; not but what our
    Ned's as good as he is."
</p>
<p>
    "Is Ned up there now?"  demanded the shoemaker, turning pale, as the
    mirthful face of Mr. Garnham suddenly occurred to him.
</p>
<p>
    "Sure to be," tittered his wife.  "And to think o' poor young Pascoe shut
    up in that stable while he's courting Celia!"
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Quince took up his knife and fork again, but his appetite had gone.
    Whoever might be paying attention to Miss Rose at that moment he felt
    quite certain that it was not Mr. Ned Quince, and he trembled with anger
    as he saw the absurd situation into which the humorous Mr. Rose had led
    him.  For years Little Haven had accepted his decisions as final and
    boasted of his sharpness to neighbouring hamlets, and many a cottager had
    brought his boots to be mended a whole week before their time for the
    sake of an interview.
</p>
<p>
    He moved his chair from the table and smoked a pipe.  Then he rose, and
    putting a couple of formidable law-books under his arm, walked slowly
    down the road in the direction of Holly Farm.
</p>
<p>
    The road was very quiet and the White Swan, usually full at this hour,
    was almost deserted, but if any doubts as to the identity of the prisoner
    lingered in his mind they were speedily dissipated by the behaviour of
    the few customers who crowded to the door to see him pass.
</p>
<p>
    A hum of voices fell on his ear as he approached the farm; half the male
    and a goodly proportion of the female population of Little Haven were
    leaning against the fence or standing in little knots in the road, while
    a few of higher social status stood in the farm-yard itself.
</p>
<p>
    "Come down to have a look at the prisoner?"  inquired the farmer, who was
    standing surrounded by a little group of admirers.

<p>
    "I came down to see you about that advice I gave you this afternoon,"
    said Mr. Quince.
</p>
<p>
    "Ah!"  said the other.
</p>
<p>
    "I was busy when you came," continued Mr. Quince, in a voice of easy
    unconcern, "and I gave you advice from memory.  Looking up the subject
    after you'd gone I found that I was wrong."
</p>
<p>
    "You don't say so?" said the farmer, uneasily.  "If I've done wrong I'm
    only doing what you told me I could do."
</p>
<p>
    "Mistakes will happen with the best of us," said the shoemaker, loudly,
    for the benefit of one or two murmurers.  "I've known a man to marry a
    woman for her money before now and find out afterward that she hadn't got
    any."
</p>
<p>
    One unit of the group detached itself and wandered listlessly toward the
    gate.
</p>
<p>
    "Well, I hope I ain't done nothing wrong," said Mr. Rose, anxiously.
    "You gave me the advice; there's men here as can prove it.  I don't want
    to do nothing agin the law.  What had I better do?"
</p>
<p>
    "Well, if I was you," said Mr. Quince, concealing his satisfaction with
    difficulty, "I should let him out at once and beg his pardon, and say you
    hope he'll do nothing about it.  I'll put in a word for you if you like
    with old Pascoe."
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Rose coughed and eyed him queerly.
</p>
<p>
    "You're a Briton," he said, warmly.  "I'll go and let him out at once."
</p>
<p>
    He strode off to the stable, despite the protests of Mr. Hogg, and,
    standing by the door, appeared to be deep in thought; then he came back
    slowly, feeling in his pockets as he walked.
</p>
<p>
    "William," he said, turning toward Mr. Hogg, "I s'pose you didn't happen
    to notice where I put that key?"
</p>
<p>
    "That I didn't," said Mr. Hogg, his face clearing suddenly.
</p>
<p>
    "I had it in my hand not half an hour ago," said the agitated Mr. Rose,
    thrusting one hand into his trouser-pocket and groping.  "It can't be
    far."
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Quince attempted to speak, and, failing, blew his nose violently.
</p>
<p>
    "My memory ain't what it used to be," said the farmer.  "Howsomever, I
    dare say it'll turn up in a day or two."
</p>
<p>
    "You&mdash;you'd better force the door," suggested Mr. Quince, struggling to
    preserve an air of judicial calm.
</p>
<p>
    "No, no," said Mr. Rose; "I ain't going to damage my property like that.
    I can lock my stable-door and unlock it when I like; if people get in
    there as have no business there, it's their look-out."
</p>
<p>
    "That's law," said Mr. Hogg; "I'll eat my hat if it ain't."
</p>
<p>
    "Do you mean to tell me you've really lost the key?" demanded Mr. Quince,
    eyeing the farmer sternly.
</p>
<p>
    "Seems like it," said Mr. Rose.  "However, he won't come to no hurt.
    I'll put in some bread and water for him, same as you advised me to."
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Quince mastered his wrath by an effort, and with no sign of
    discomposure moved away without making any reference to the identity of
    the unfortunate in the stable.
</p>
<p>
    "Good-night," said the farmer, "and thank you for coming and giving me
    the fresh advice.  It ain't everybody that 'ud ha' taken the trouble.
    If I hadn't lost that key&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>
<p>
    The shoemaker scowled, and with the two fat books under his arm passed
    the listening neighbours with the air of a thoughtful man out for an
    evening stroll.  Once inside his house, however, his manner changed, the
    attitude of Mrs. Quince demanding, at any rate, a show of concern.
</p>
<p>
    "It's no good talking," he said at last.  "Ned shouldn't have gone there,
    and as for going to law about it, I sha'n't do any such thing; I should
    never hear the end of it.  I shall just go on as usual, as if nothing had
    happened, and when Rose is tired of keeping him there he must let him
    out.  I'll bide my time."
</p>
<p>
    Mrs. Quince subsided into vague mutterings as to what she would do if she
    were a man, coupled with sundry aspersions upon the character, looks, and
    family connections of Farmer Rose, which somewhat consoled her for being
    what she was.
</p>
<p>
    "He has always made jokes about your advice," she said at length, "and
    now everybody'll think he's right.  I sha'n't be able to look anybody in
    the face.  I should have seen through it at once if it had been me.  I'm
    going down to give him a bit o' my mind."
</p>
<p>
    "You stay where you are," said Mr. Quince, sharply, "and, mind, you are
    not to talk about it to anybody.  Farmer Rose 'ud like nothing better
    than to see us upset about it.  I ain't done with him yet.  You wait."
</p>
<p>
    Mrs. Quince, having no option, waited, but nothing happened.  The
    following day found Ned Quince still a prisoner, and, considering the
    circumstances, remarkably cheerful.  He declined point-blank to renounce
    his preposterous attentions, and said that, living on the premises, he
    felt half like a son-in-law already.  He also complimented the farmer
    upon the quality of his bread.
</p>
<p>
    The next morning found him still unsubdued, and, under interrogation from
    the farmer, he admitted that he liked it, and said that the feeling of
    being at home was growing upon him.
</p>
<p>
    "If you're satisfied, I am," said Mr. Rose, grimly.  "I'll keep you here
    till you promise; mind that."
</p>
<p>
    "It's a nobleman's life," said Ned, peeping through the window, "and I'm
    beginning to like you as much as my real father."
</p>
<p>
    "I don't want none o' yer impudence," said the farmer, reddening.
</p>

</center>
<!--IMAGE END-->
<p>
    "You'll like me better when you've had me here a little longer," said
    Ned; "I shall grow on you.  Why not be reasonable and make up your mind
    to it?  Celia and I have."
</p>
<p>
    "I'm going to send Celia away on Saturday," said Mr. Rose; "make yourself
    happy and comfortable in here till then.  If you'd like another crust o'
    bread or an extra half pint o' water you've only got to mention it.  When
    she's gone I'll have a hunt for that key, so as you can go back to your
    father and help him to understand his law-books better."
</p>
<p>
    He strode off with the air of a conqueror, and having occasion to go to
    the village looked in at the shoe-maker's window as he passed and smiled
    broadly.  For years Little Haven had regarded Mr. Quince with awe, as
    being far too dangerous a man for the lay mind to tamper with, and at one
    stroke the farmer had revealed the hollowness of his pretensions.  Only
    that morning the wife of a labourer had called and asked him to hurry the
    mending of a pair of boots.  She was a voluble woman, and having overcome
    her preliminary nervousness more than hinted that if he gave less time to
    the law and more to his trade it would be better for himself and
    everybody else.
</p>
<p>
    Miss Rose accepted her lot in a spirit of dutiful resignation, and on
    Saturday morning after her father's admonition not to forget that the
    coach left the White Swan at two sharp, set off to pay a few farewell
    visits.  By half-past twelve she had finished, and Lawyer Quince becoming
    conscious of a shadow on his work looked up to see her standing before
    the window.  He replied to a bewitching smile with a short nod and became
    intent upon his work again.
</p>
<p>
    For a short time Celia lingered, then to his astonishment she opened the
    gate and walked past the side of the house into the garden.  With growing
    astonishment he observed her enter his tool-shed and close the door
    behind her.
</p>
<p>
    For ten minutes he worked on and then, curiosity getting the better of
    him, he walked slowly to the tool-shed and, opening the door a little
    way, peeped in.  It was a small shed, crowded with agricultural
    implements.  The floor was occupied by an upturned wheelbarrow, and
    sitting on the barrow, with her soft cheek leaning against the wall, sat
    Miss Rose fast asleep.  Mr. Quince coughed several times, each cough
    being louder than the last, and then, treading softly, was about to
    return to the workshop when the girl stirred and muttered in her sleep.
    At first she was unintelligible, then he distinctly caught the words
    "idiot" and "blockhead."
</p>
<p>
    "She's dreaming of somebody," said Mr. Quince to himself with conviction.
</p>
<p>
    "Wonder who it is?"
</p>
<p>
    "Can't see&mdash;a thing&mdash;under&mdash;his&mdash;nose," murmured the fair sleeper.
</p>
<p>
    "Celia!"  said Mr. Quince, sharply.  "Celia!"
</p>
<p>
    He took a hoe from the wall and prodded her gently with the handle.  A
    singularly vicious expression marred the soft features, but that was all.
</p>
<p>
    "Ce-lia!"  said the shoemaker, who feared sun-stroke.
</p>
<p>
    "Fancy if he&mdash;had&mdash;a moment's common sense," murmured Celia, drowsily,
    "and locked&mdash;the door."
</p>
<p>
    Lawyer Quince dropped the hoe with a clatter and stood regarding her
    open-mouthed.  He was a careful man with his property, and the stout door
    boasted a good lock.  He sped to the house on tip-toe, and taking the key
    from its nail on the kitchen dresser returned to the shed, and after
    another puzzled glance at the sleeping girl locked her in.
</p>
<p>
    For half an hour he sat in silent enjoyment of the situation&mdash;enjoyment
    which would have been increased if he could have seen Mr. Rose standing
    at the gate of Holly Farm, casting anxious glances up and down the road.
    Celia's luggage had gone down to the White Swan, and an excellent cold
    luncheon was awaiting her attention in the living-room.
</p>
<p>
    Half-past one came and no Celia, and five minutes later two farm
    labourers and a boy lumbered off in different directions in search of the
    missing girl, with instructions that she was to go straight to the White
    Swan to meet the coach.  The farmer himself walked down to the inn,
    turning over in his mind a heated lecture composed for the occasion, but
    the coach came and, after a cheerful bustle and the consumption of sundry
    mugs of beer, sped on its way again.
</p>
<p>
    He returned home in silent consternation, seeking in vain for a
    satisfactory explanation of the mystery.  For a robust young woman to
    disappear in broad day-light and leave no trace behind her was
    extraordinary.  Then a sudden sinking sensation in the region of the
    waistcoat and an idea occurred simultaneously.
</p>
<p>
    He walked down to the village again, the idea growing steadily all the
    way.  Lawyer Quince was hard at work, as usual, as he passed.  He went by
    the window three times and gazed wistfully at the cottage.  Coming to the
    conclusion at last that two heads were better than one in such a
    business, he walked on to the mill and sought Mr. Hogg.
</p>
<p>
    "That's what it is," said the miller, as he breathed his suspicions.
    "I thought all along Lawyer Quince would have the laugh of you.  He's
    wonderful deep. Now, let's go to work cautious like.  Try and look as if
    nothing had happened."
</p>
<a name="image-25"><!--IMG--></a>

alt="'i Thought All Along Lawyer Quince Would Have the Laugh Of

">
</center>
<!--IMAGE END-->
<p>
    Mr. Rose tried.
</p>
<p>
    "Try agin," said the miller, with some severity.  "Get the red out o'
    your face and let your eyes go back and don't look as though you're going
    to bite somebody."
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Rose swallowed an angry retort, and with an attempt at careless ease
    sauntered up the road with the miller to the shoemaker's.  Lawyer Quince
    was still busy, and looked up inquiringly as they passed before him.
</p>
<p>
    "I s'pose," said the diplomatic Mr. Hogg, who was well acquainted with
    his neighbour's tidy and methodical habits&mdash;"I s'pose you couldn't lend
    me your barrow for half an hour?  The wheel's off mine."
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Quince hesitated, and then favoured him with a glance intended to
    remind him of his scurvy behaviour three days before.
</p>
<p>
    "You can have it," he said at last, rising.
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Hogg pinched his friend in his excitement, and both watched Mr.
    Quince with bated breath as he took long, slow strides toward the
    tool-shed.  He tried the door and then went into the house, and even
    before his reappearance both gentlemen knew only too well what was about
    to happen.  Red was all too poor a word to apply to Mr. Rose's
    countenance as the shoemaker came toward them, feeling in his waist-coat
    pocket with hooked fingers and thumb, while Mr. Hogg's expressive
    features were twisted into an appearance of rosy appreciation.
</p>
<p>
    "Did you want the barrow very particular?" inquired the shoemaker, in a
    regretful voice.
</p>
<p>
    "Very particular," said Mr. Hogg.
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Quince went through the performance of feeling in all his pockets,
    and then stood meditatively rubbing his chin.
</p>
<p>
    "The door's locked," he said, slowly, "and what I've done with that there
    key&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>
<p>
    "You open that door," vociferated Mr. Rose, "else I'll break it in.
    You've got my daughter in that shed and I'm going to have her out."
</p>
<p>
    "Your daughter?" said Mr. Quince, with an air of faint surprise.  "What
    should she be doing in my shed?"
</p>
<p>
    "You let her out," stormed Mr. Rose, trying to push past him.
</p>
<p>
    "Don't trespass on my premises," said Lawyer Quince, interposing his
    long, gaunt frame.  "If you want that door opened you'll have to wait
    till my boy Ned comes home.  I expect he knows where to find the key."
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Rose's hands fell limply by his side and his tongue, turning prudish,
    refused its office.  He turned and stared at Mr. Hogg in silent
    consternation.
</p>
<p>
    "Never known him to be beaten yet," said that admiring weather-cock.
</p>
<p>
    "Ned's been away three days," said the shoemaker, "but I expect him home
    soon."
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Rose made a strange noise in his throat and then, accepting his
    defeat, set off at a rapid pace in the direction of home.  In a
    marvellously short space of time, considering his age and figure, he was
    seen returning with Ned Quince, flushed and dishevelled, walking by his
    side.
</p>
<p>
    "Here he is," said the farmer.  "Now where's that key?"
</p>
<p>
    Lawyer Quince took his son by the arm and led him into the house, from
    whence they almost immediately emerged with Ned waving the key.
</p>
<p>
    "I thought it wasn't far," said the sapient Mr. Hogg.
</p>
<p>
    Ned put the key in the lock and flinging the door open revealed Celia
    Rose, blinking and confused in the sudden sunshine.  She drew back as she
    saw her father and began to cry with considerable fervour.
</p>
<p>
    "How did you get in that shed, miss?"  demanded her parent, stamping.
</p>

<!--IMAGE END-->
<p>
    Miss Rose trembled.
</p>
<p>
    "I&mdash;I went there," she sobbed.  "I didn't want to go away."
</p>
<p>
    "Well, you'd better stay there," shouted the over-wrought Mr. Rose.
    "I've done with you.  A girl that 'ud turn against her own father I&mdash;I&mdash;"
</p>
<p>
    He drove his right fist into his left palm and stamped out into the road.
    Lawyer Quince and Mr. Hogg, after a moment's hesitation, followed.
</p>
<p>
    "The laugh's agin you, farmer," said the latter gentleman, taking his
    arm.
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Rose shook him off.
</p>
<p>
    "Better make the best of it," continued the peace-maker.
</p>
<p>
    "She's a girl to be proud of," said Lawyer Quince, keeping pace with the
    farmer on the other side.  "She's got a head that's worth yours and mine
    put together, with Hogg's thrown in as a little makeweight."
</p>
<p>
    "And here's the White Swan," said Mr. Hogg, who had a hazy idea of a
    compliment, "and all of us as dry as a bone.  Why not all go in and have
    a glass to shut folks' mouths?"
</p>
<p>
    "And cry quits," said the shoemaker.
</p>
<p>
    "And let bygones be bygones," said Mr. Hogg, taking the farmer's arm
    again.
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Rose stopped and shook his head obstinately, and then, under the
    skilful pilotage of Mr. Hogg, was steered in the direction of the
    hospitable doors of the White Swan.  He made a last bid for liberty on
    the step and then disappeared inside.  Lawyer Quince brought up the rear.

    BREAKING A SPELL
</h2>
<p>
    "Witchcraft?" said the old man, thoughtfully, as he scratched his scanty
    whiskers.  No, I ain't heard o' none in these parts for a long time.
    There used to be a little of it about when I was a boy, and there was
    some talk of it arter I'd growed up, but Claybury folk never took much
    count of it.  The last bit of it I remember was about forty years ago,
    and that wasn't so much witchcraft as foolishness.
</p>
<p>
    There was a man in this place then&mdash;Joe Barlcomb by name&mdash;who was a firm
    believer in it, and 'e used to do all sorts of things to save hisself
    from it.  He was a new-comer in Claybury, and there was such a lot of it
    about in the parts he came from that the people thought o' nothing else
    hardly.
</p>
<p>
    He was a man as got 'imself very much liked at fust, especially by the
    old ladies, owing to his being so perlite to them, that they used to 'old
    'im up for an example to the other men, and say wot nice, pretty ways he
    'ad.  Joe Barlcomb was everything at fust, but when they got to 'ear that
    his perliteness was because 'e thought 'arf of 'em was witches, and
    didn't know which 'arf, they altered their minds.

<p>
    In a month or two he was the laughing-stock of the place; but wot was
    worse to 'im than that was that he'd made enemies of all the old ladies.
    Some of 'em was free-spoken women, and 'e couldn't sleep for thinking of
    the 'arm they might do 'im.
</p>
<p>
    He was terrible uneasy about it at fust, but, as nothing 'appened and he
    seemed to go on very prosperous-like, 'e began to forget 'is fears, when
    all of a sudden 'e went 'ome one day and found 'is wife in bed with a
    broken leg.
</p>
<p>
    She was standing on a broken chair to reach something down from the
    dresser when it 'appened, and it was pointed out to Joe Barlcomb that it
    was a thing anybody might ha' done without being bewitched; but he said
    'e knew better, and that they'd kept that broken chair for standing on
    for years and years to save the others, and nothing 'ad ever 'appened
    afore.
</p>
<p>
    In less than a week arter that three of his young 'uns was down with the
    measles, and, 'is wife being laid up, he sent for 'er mother to come and
    nurse 'em.  It's as true as I sit 'ere, but that pore old lady 'adn't
    been in the house two hours afore she went to bed with the yellow
    jaundice.
</p>
<p>
    Joe Barlcomb went out of 'is mind a'most.  He'd never liked 'is wife's
    mother, and he wouldn't 'ave had 'er in the house on'y 'e wanted her to
    nurse 'is wife and children, and when she came and laid up and wanted
    waiting on 'e couldn't dislike her enough.
</p>
<p>
    He was quite certain all along that somebody was putting a spell on 'im,
    and when 'e went out a morning or two arterward and found 'is best pig
    lying dead in a corner of the sty he gave up and, going into the 'ouse,
    told 'em all that they'd 'ave to die 'cause he couldn't do anything more
    for 'em.  His wife's mother and 'is wife and the children all started
    crying together, and Joe Barlcomb, when 'e thought of 'is pig, he sat
    down and cried too.
</p>
<p>
    He sat up late that night thinking it over, and, arter looking at it all
    ways, he made up 'is mind to go and see Mrs. Prince, an old lady that
    lived all alone by 'erself in a cottage near Smith's farm.  He'd set 'er
    down for wot he called a white witch, which is the best kind and on'y do
    useful things, such as charming warts away or telling gals about their
    future 'usbands; and the next arternoon, arter telling 'is wife's mother
    that fresh air and travelling was the best cure for the yellow jaundice,
    he set off to see 'er.

<p>
    Mrs. Prince was sitting at 'er front door nursing 'er three cats when 'e
    got there.  She was an ugly, little old woman with piercing black eyes
    and a hook nose, and she 'ad a quiet, artful sort of a way with 'er that
    made 'er very much disliked.  One thing was she was always making fun of
    people, and for another she seemed to be able to tell their thoughts, and
    that don't get anybody liked much, especially when they don't keep it to
    theirselves.  She'd been a lady's maid all 'er young days, and it was
    very 'ard to be taken for a witch just because she was old.
</p>
<p>
    "Fine day, ma'am," ses Joe Barlcomb.

<p>
    "Very fine," ses Mrs. Prince.
</p>
<p>
    "Being as I was passing, I just thought I'd look in," ses Joe Barlcomb,
    eyeing the cats.
</p>
<p>
    "Take a chair," ses Mrs. Prince, getting up and dusting one down with 'er
    apron.
</p>
<p>
    Joe sat down.  "I'm in a bit o' trouble, ma'am," he ses, "and I thought

    my little place with the yellow jaundice, and the pig's dead."
</p>
<p>
    "Wot, another one?"  ses Mrs. Prince.
</p>
<p>
    "No; the same one," ses Joe.
</p>
<p>
    "Well, 'ow am I to help you?"  ses Mrs. Prince.  "Do you want me to come
    and nurse 'em?"
</p>
<p>
    "No, no," ses Joe, starting and turning pale; "unless you'd like to come
    and nurse my wife's mother," he ses, arter thinking a bit.  "I was hoping
    that you'd know who'd been overlooking me and that you'd make 'em take
    the spell off."
</p>
<p>
    Mrs. Prince got up from 'er chair and looked round for the broom she'd
    been sweeping with, but, not finding it, she set down agin and stared in
    a curious sort o' way at Joe Barlcomb.
</p>
<p>
    "Oh, I see," she ses, nodding.  "Fancy you guessing I was a witch."
</p>
<p>
    "You can't deceive me," ses Joe; "I've 'ad too much experience; I knew it
    the fust time I saw you by the mole on your nose."
</p>
<p>
    Mrs. Prince got up and went into her back-place, trying her 'ardest to
    remember wot she'd done with that broom.  She couldn't find it anywhere,
    and at last she came back and sat staring at Joe for so long that 'e was
    'arf frightened out of his life.  And by-and-by she gave a 'orrible smile
    and sat rubbing the side of 'er nose with 'er finger.
</p>
<p>
    "If I help you," she ses at last, "will you promise to keep it a dead
    secret and do exactly as I tell you?  If you don't, dead pigs'll be
    nothing to the misfortunes that you will 'ave."
</p>
<p>
    "I will," ses Joe Barlcomb, very pale.
</p>
<p>
    "The spell," ses Mrs. Prince, holding up her 'ands and shutting 'er eyes,
    "was put upon you by a man.  It is one out of six men as is jealous of
    you because you're so clever, but which one it is I can't tell without
    your assistance.  Have you got any money?"
</p>
<p>
    "A little," ses Joe, anxious-like&mdash; "a very little.  Wot with the yellow
    jaundice and other things, I&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>
<p>
    "Fust thing to do," ses Mrs. Prince, still with her eyes shut, "you go up
    to the Cauliflower to-night; the six men'll all be there, and you must
    buy six ha'pennies off of them; one each."
</p>
<p>
    "Buy six ha'pennies?"  ses Joe, staring at her.
</p>
<p>
    "Don't repeat wot I say," ses Mrs. Prince; "it's unlucky.  You buy six
    ha'pennies for a shilling each, without saying wot it's for.  You'll be
    able to buy 'em all right if you're civil."
</p>
<p>
    "It seems to me it don't need much civility for that," ses Joe, pulling a
    long face.
</p>
<p>
    "When you've got the ha'pennies," ses Mrs. Prince, "bring 'em to me and
    I'll tell you wot to do with 'em.  Don't lose no time, because I can see
    that something worse is going to 'appen if it ain't prevented."
</p>
<p>
    "Is it anything to do with my wife's mother getting worse?"  ses Joe
    Barlcomb, who was a careful man and didn't want to waste six shillings.
</p>
<p>
    "No, something to you," ses Mrs. Prince.
</p>
<p>
    Joe Barlcomb went cold all over, and then he put down a couple of eggs
    he'd brought round for 'er and went off 'ome agin, and Mrs. Prince stood
    in the doorway with a cat on each shoulder and watched 'im till 'e was
    out of sight.
</p>
<p>
    That night Joe Barlcomb came up to this 'ere Cauliflower public-house,
    same as he'd been told, and by-and-by, arter he 'ad 'ad a pint, he looked
    round, and taking a shilling out of 'is pocket put it on the table, and
    he ses, "Who'll give me a ha'penny for that?"  he ses.
</p>
<p>
    None of 'em seemed to be in a hurry.  Bill Jones took it up and bit it,
    and rang it on the table and squinted at it, and then he bit it agin, and
    turned round and asked Joe Barlcomb wot was wrong with it.
</p>
<p>
    "Wrong?" ses Joe; "nothing."
</p>
<p>
    Bill Jones put it down agin.  "You're wide awake, Joe," he ses, "but so
    am I."
</p>
<p>
    "Won't nobody give me a ha'penny for it?"  ses Joe, looking round.
</p>
<p>
    Then Peter Lamb came up, and he looked at it and rang it, and at last he
    gave Joe a ha'penny for it and took it round, and everybody 'ad a look at
    it.

<p>
    "It stands to reason it's a bad 'un," ses Bill Jones, "but it's so well
    done I wish as I'd bought it."
</p>
<p>
    "H-s-h!"  ses Peter Lamb; "don't let the landlord 'ear you."
</p>
<p>
    The landlord 'ad just that moment come in, and Peter walked up and
    ordered a pint, and took his ten-pence change as bold as brass.  Arter
    that Joe Barbcomb bought five more ha'pennies afore you could wink
    a'most, and every man wot sold one went up to the bar and 'ad a pint and
    got tenpence change, and drank Joe Barlcomb's health.
</p>
<p>
    "There seems to be a lot o' money knocking about to-night," ses the
    landlord, as Sam Martin, the last of 'em, was drinking 'is pint.
</p>
<p>
    Sam Martin choked and put 'is pot down on the counter with a bang, and
    him and the other five was out o' that door and sailing up the road with
    their tenpences afore the landlord could get his breath.  He stood to the
    bar scratching his 'ead and staring, but he couldn't understand it a bit
    till a man wot was too late to sell his ha'penny up and told 'im all
    about it.  The fuss 'e made was terrible.  The shillings was in a little
    heap on a shelf at the back o' the bar, and he did all sorts o' things to
    'em to prove that they was bad, and threatened Joe Barlcomb with the
    police.  At last, however, 'e saw wot a fool he was making of himself,
    and arter nearly breaking his teeth 'e dropped them into a drawer and
    stirred 'em up with the others.
</p>
<p>
    Joe Barlcomb went round the next night to see Mrs. Prince, and she asked
    'im a lot o' questions about the men as 'ad sold 'im the ha'pennies.
</p>
<p>
    "The fust part 'as been done very well," she ses, nodding her 'ead at
    'im; "if you do the second part as well, you'll soon know who your enemy
    is."
</p>
<p>
    "Nothing'll bring the pig back," ses Joe.
</p>
<p>
    "There's worse misfortunes than that, as I've told you," ses Mrs. Prince,
    sharply.  "Now, listen to wot I'm going to say to you.  When the clock
    strikes twelve to-night&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>
<p>
    "Our clock don't strike," ses Joe.
</p>
<p>
    "Then you must borrow one that does," ses Mrs. Prince, "and when it
    strikes twelve you must go round to each o' them six men and sell them a
    ha'penny for a shilling."
</p>
<p>
    Joe Barlcomb looked at 'er.  "'Ow?"  he ses, short-like.
</p>
<p>
    "Same way as you sold 'em a shilling for a ha'-penny," ses Mrs. Prince;
    "it don't matter whether they buy the ha'pennies or not.  All you've got
    to do is to go and ask 'em, and the man as makes the most fuss is the man
    that 'as put the trouble on you."
</p>
<p>
    "It seems a roundabout way o' going to work," ses Joe.
</p>
<p>
    "<i>Wot!</i>"  screams Mrs. Prince, jumping up and waving her arms about.
    "<i>Wot!</i>  Go your own way; I'll have nothing more to do with you.  And
    don't blame me for anything that happens.  It's a very bad thing to come
    to a witch for advice and then not to do as she tells you.  You ought to
    know that."
</p>
<p>
    "I'll do it, ma'am," ses Joe Barlcomb, trembling.
</p>
<p>
    "You'd better," ses Mrs. Prince; "and mind&mdash;not a word to anybody."
</p>
<p>
    Joe promised her agin, and 'e went off and borrered a clock from Albert
    Price, and at twelve o'clock that night he jumped up out of bed and began
    to dress 'imself and pretend not to 'ear his wife when she asked 'im
    where he was going.
</p>
<p>
    It was a dark, nasty sort o' night, blowing and raining, and, o' course,
    everybody 'ad gone to bed long since.  The fust cottage Joe came to was
    Bill Jones's, and, knowing Bill's temper, he stood for some time afore he
    could make up 'is mind to knock; but at last he up with 'is stick and
    banged away at the door.
</p>
<p>
    A minute arterward he 'eard the bedroom winder pushed open, and then Bill
    Jones popped his 'cad out and called to know wot was the matter and who
    it was.
</p>
<p>
    "It's me&mdash;Joe Barlcomb," ses Joe, "and I want to speak to you very
    partikler."
</p>
<p>
    "Well, speak away," ses Bill.  "You go into the back room," he ses,
    turning to his wife.
</p>
<p>
    "Whaffor?"  ses Mrs. Jones.
</p>
<p>
    "'Cos I don't know wot Joe is going to say," ses Bill.  "You go in now,
    afore I make you."
</p>
<p>
    His wife went off grumbling, and then Bill told Joe Barlcomb to hurry up
    wot he'd got to say as 'e 'adn't got much on and the weather wasn't as
    warm as it might be.
</p>
<p>
    "I sold you a shilling for a ha'penny last night, Bill," ses Joe.
</p>
<p>
    "Do you want to sell any more?"  ses Bill Jones, putting his 'and down to
    where 'is trouser pocket ought to be.
</p>
<p>
    "Not exactly that," ses Joe Barlcomb.  "This time I want you to sell me a
    shilling for a ha'penny."
</p>
<p>
    Bill leaned out of the winder and stared down at Joe Barlcomb, and then
    he ses, in a choking voice,  "Is that wot you've come disturbing my sleep
    for at this time o' night?"  he ses.
</p>
<p>
    "I must 'ave it, Bill," ses Joe.
</p>
<p>
    "Well, if you'll wait a moment," ses Bill, trying to speak perlitely,
    "I'll come down and give it to you."
</p>
<p>
    Joe didn't like 'is tone of voice, but he waited, and all of a sudden
    Bill Jones came out o' that door like a gun going off and threw 'imself
    on Joe Barlcomb.  Both of 'em was strong men, and by the time they'd
    finished they was so tired they could 'ardly stand.  Then Bill Jones went
    back to bed, and Joe Barlcomb, arter sitting down on the doorstep to rest
    'imself, went off and knocked up Peter Lamb.
</p>
<p>
    Peter Lamb was a little man and no good as a fighter, but the things he
    said to Joe Barlcomb as he leaned out o' the winder and shook 'is fist at
    him was 'arder to bear than blows.  He screamed away at the top of 'is
    voice for ten minutes, and then 'e pulled the winder to with a bang and
    went back to bed.
</p>
<p>
    Joe Barlcomb was very tired, but he walked on to Jasper Potts's 'ouse,
    trying 'ard as he walked to decide which o' the fust two 'ad made the
    most fuss.  Arter he 'ad left Jasper Potts 'e got more puzzled than ever,
    Jasper being just as bad as the other two, and Joe leaving 'im at last in
    the middle of loading 'is gun.
</p>
<p>
    By the time he'd made 'is last call&mdash;at Sam Martin's&mdash;it was past three
    o'clock, and he could no more tell Mrs. Prince which 'ad made the most
    fuss than 'e could fly.  There didn't seem to be a pin to choose between
    'em, and, 'arf worried out of 'is life, he went straight on to Mrs.
    Prince and knocked 'er up to tell 'er.  She thought the 'ouse was afire
    at fust, and came screaming out o' the front door in 'er bedgown, and
    when she found out who it was she was worse to deal with than the men 'ad
    been.
</p>
<p>
    She 'ad quieted down by the time Joe went round to see 'er the next
    evening, and asked 'im to describe exactly wot the six men 'ad done and
    said.  She sat listening quite quiet at fust, but arter a time she scared
    Joe by making a odd, croupy sort o' noise in 'er throat, and at last she
    got up and walked into the back-place.  She was there a long time making
    funny noises, and at last Joe walked toward the door on tip-toe and
    peeped through the crack and saw 'er in a sort o' fit, sitting in a chair
    with 'er arms folded acrost her bodice and rocking 'erself up and down
    and moaning.  Joe stood as if 'e'd been frozen a'most, and then 'e crept
    back to 'is seat and waited, and when she came into the room agin she
    said as the trouble 'ad all been caused by Bill Jones.  She sat still for
    nearly 'arf an hour, thinking 'ard, and then she turned to Joe and ses:

<!--IMAGE END-->
<p>
    "Can you read?" she ses.
</p>
<p>
    "No," ses Joe, wondering wot was coming next.
</p>
<p>
    "That's all right, then," she ses, "because if you could I couldn't do
    wot I'm going to do."
</p>
<p>
    "That shows the 'arm of eddication," ses Joe.  "I never did believe in
    it."
</p>
<p>
    Mrs. Prince nodded, and then she went and got a bottle with something in
    it which looked to Joe like gin, and arter getting out 'er pen and ink
    and printing some words on a piece o' paper she stuck it on the bottle,
    and sat looking at Joe and thinking.
</p>
<p>
    "Take this up to the Cauliflower," she ses, "make friends with Bill
    Jones, and give him as much beer as he'll drink, and give 'im a little o'
    this gin in each mug.  If he drinks it the spell will be broken, and
    you'll be luckier than you 'ave ever been in your life afore.  When 'e's
    drunk some, and not before, leave the bottle standing on the table."
</p>
<p>
    Joe Barlcomb thanked 'er, and with the bottle in 'is pocket went off to
    the Cauliflower, whistling.  Bill Jones was there, and Peter Lamb, and
    two or three more of 'em, and at fust they said some pretty 'ard things
    to him about being woke up in the night.
</p>
<p>
    "Don't bear malice, Bill," ses Joe Barlcomb; "'ave a pint with me."
</p>
<p>
    He ordered two pints, and then sat down along-side o' Bill, and in five
    minutes they was like brothers.
</p>
<p>
    "'Ave a drop o' gin in it, Bill," he ses, taking the bottle out of 'is
    pocket.
</p>
<p>
    Bill thanked 'im and had a drop, and then, thoughtful-like, he wanted Joe
    to 'ave some in his too, but Joe said no, he'd got a touch o' toothache,
    and it was bad for it.
</p>
<p>
    "I don't mind 'aving a drop in my beer, Joe," ses Peter Lamb.
</p>
<p>
    "Not to-night, mate," ses Joe; "it's all for Bill.  I bought it on
    purpose for 'im."
</p>
<p>
    Bill shook 'ands with him, and when Joe called for another pint and put
    some more gin in it he said that 'e was the noblest-'arted man that ever
    lived.
</p>
<p>
    "You wasn't saying so 'arf an hour ago," ses Peter Lamb.
</p>
<p>
    "'Cos I didn't know 'im so well then," ses Bill Jones.
</p>
<p>
    "You soon change your mind, don't you?"  ses Peter.
</p>
<p>
    Bill didn't answer 'im.  He was leaning back on the bench and staring at
    the bottle as if 'e couldn't believe his eyesight.  His face was all
    white and shining, and 'is hair as wet as if it 'ad just been dipped in a
    bucket o' water.
</p>
<p>
    "See a ghost, Bill?"  ses Peter, looking at 'im.
</p>
<p>
    Bill made a 'orrible noise in his throat, and kept on staring at the
    bottle till they thought 'e'd gone crazy.  Then Jasper Potts bent his
    'ead down and began to read out loud wot was on the bottle.  "P-o-i&mdash;
    POISON FOR BILL JONES," he ses, in a voice as if 'e couldn't believe it.
</p>
<p>
    You might 'ave heard a pin drop.  Everybody turned and looked at Bill
    Jones, as he sat there trembling all over.  Then those that could read
    took up the bottle and read it out loud all over agin.
</p>
<p>
    "Pore Bill," ses Peter Lamb.  "I 'ad a feeling come over me that
    something was wrong."
</p>
<p>
    "You're a murderer," ses Sam Martin, catching 'old of Joe Barlcomb.
    "You'll be 'ung for this.  Look at pore Bill, cut off in 'is prime."
</p>
<p>
    "Run for the doctor," ses someone.
</p>
<p>
    Two of 'em ran off as 'ard as they could go, and then the landlord came
    round the bar and asked Bill to go and die outside, because 'e didn't
    want to be brought into it.  Jasper Potts told 'im to clear off, and then
    he bent down and asked Bill where the pain was.
</p>
<p>
    "I don't think he'll 'ave much pain," ses Peter Lamb, who always
    pretended to know a lot more than other people.  "It'll soon be over,
    Bill."
</p>
<p>
    "We've all got to go some day," ses Sam Martin.  "Better to die young
    than live to be a trouble to yourself," ses Bob Harris.
</p>
<p>
    To 'ear them talk everybody seemed to think that Bill Jones was in luck;
    everybody but Bill Jones 'imself, that is.
</p>
<p>
    "I ain't fit to die," he ses, shivering.  "You don't know 'ow bad I've
    been."
</p>
<p>
    "Wot 'ave you done, Bill?"  ses Peter Lamb, in a soft voice.  "If it'll
    ease your feelings afore you go to make a clean breast of it, we're all
    friends here."
</p>
<p>
    Bill groaned.
</p>
<p>
    "And it's too late for you to be punished for anything," ses Peter, arter
    a moment.
</p>
<p>
    Bill Jones groaned agin, and then, shaking 'is 'ead, began to w'isper 'is
    wrong-doings.  When the doctor came in 'arf an hour arterward all the men
    was as quiet as mice, and pore Bill was still w'ispering as 'ard as he
    could w'isper.
</p>
<p>
    The doctor pushed 'em out of the way in a moment, and then 'e bent over
    Bill and felt 'is pulse and looked at 'is tongue.  Then he listened to
    his 'art, and in a puzzled way smelt at the bottle, which Jasper Potts
    was a-minding of, and wetted 'is finger and tasted it.

    "Somebody's been making a fool of you and me too," he ses, in a angry
    voice.  "It's only gin, and very good gin at that.  Get up and go home."
</p>
<p>
    It all came out next morning, and Joe Barlcomb was the laughing-stock of
    the place.  Most people said that Mrs. Prince 'ad done quite right, and
    they 'oped that it ud be a lesson to him, but nobody ever talked much of
    witchcraft in Claybury agin.  One thing was that Bill Jones wouldn't 'ave
    the word used in 'is hearing.

<p>
    Mr. Richard Catesby, second officer of the ss. <i>Wizard</i>, emerged from the
    dock-gates in high good-humour to spend an evening ashore.  The bustle of
    the day had departed, and the inhabitants of Wapping, in search of
    coolness and fresh air, were sitting at open doors and windows indulging
    in general conversation with any-body within earshot.

</center>
<!--IMAGE END-->
<p>
    Mr. Catesby, turning into Bashford's Lane, lost in a moment all this life
    and colour.  The hum of distant voices certainly reached there, but that
    was all, for Bashford's Lane, a retiring thoroughfare facing a blank dock
    wall, capped here and there by towering spars, set an example of
    gentility which neighbouring streets had long ago decided crossly was
    impossible for ordinary people to follow.  Its neatly grained shutters,
    fastened back by the sides of the windows, gave a pleasing idea of
    uniformity, while its white steps and polished brass knockers were
    suggestive of almost a Dutch cleanliness.
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Catesby, strolling comfortably along, stopped suddenly for another
    look at a girl who was standing in the ground-floor window of No. 5.  He
    went on a few paces and then walked back slowly, trying to look as though
    he had forgotten something.  The girl was still there, and met his ardent
    glances unmoved: a fine girl, with large, dark eyes, and a complexion
    which was the subject of much scandalous discussion among neighbouring
    matrons.
</p>
<p>
    "It must be something wrong with the glass, or else it's the bad light,"
    said Mr. Catesby to himself; "no girl is so beautiful as that."
</p>
<p>
    He went by again to make sure.  The object of his solicitude was still
    there and apparently unconscious of his existence.  He passed very slowly
    and sighed deeply.
</p>
<p>
    "You've got it at last, Dick Catesby," he said, solemnly; "fair and
    square in the most dangerous part of the heart.  It's serious this time."
</p>
<p>
    He stood still on the narrow pavement, pondering, and then, in excuse of
    his flagrant misbehaviour, murmured, "It was meant to be," and went by
    again.  This time he fancied that he detected a somewhat supercilious
    expression in the dark eyes&mdash;a faint raising of well-arched eyebrows.
</p>
<p>
    His engagement to wait at Aldgate Station for the second-engineer and
    spend an evening together was dismissed as too slow to be considered.  He
    stood for some time in uncertainty, and then turning slowly into the
    Beehive, which stood at the corner, went into the private bar and ordered
    a glass of beer.
</p>
<p>
    He was the only person in the bar, and the land-lord, a stout man in his
    shirt-sleeves, was the soul of affability.  Mr. Catesby, after various
    general remarks, made a few inquiries about an uncle aged five minutes,
    whom he thought was living in Bashford's Lane.

<p>
    "I don't know 'im," said the landlord.
</p>
<p>
    "I had an idea that he lived at No. 5," said Catesby.
</p>
<p>
    The landlord shook his head.  "That's Mrs. Truefitt's house," he said,
    slowly.
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Catesby pondered.  "Truefitt, Truefitt," he repeated; "what sort of a
    woman is she?"
</p>
<p>
    "Widder-woman," said the landlord; "she lives there with 'er daughter
    Prudence."
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Catesby said "Indeed!" and being a good listener learned that Mrs.
    Truefitt was the widow of a master-lighterman, and that her son, Fred
    Truefitt, after an absence of seven years in New Zealand, was now on his
    way home.  He finished his glass slowly and, the landlord departing to
    attend to another customer, made his way into the street again.
</p>
<p>
    He walked along slowly, picturing as he went the home-corning of the
    long-absent son.  Things were oddly ordered in this world, and Fred
    Truefitt would probably think nothing of his brotherly privileges.  He
    wondered whether he was like Prudence.  He wondered&mdash;&mdash;
</p>
<p>
    "By Jove, I'll do it!"  he said, recklessly, as he turned.  "Now for a
    row."
</p>
<p>
    He walked back rapidly to Bashford's Lane, and without giving his courage
    time to cool plied the knocker of No. 5 briskly.
</p>
<p>
    The door was opened by an elderly woman, thin, and somewhat querulous in
    expression.  Mr. Catesby had just time to notice this, and then he flung
    his arm round her waist, and hailing her as "Mother!" saluted her warmly.
</p>
<p>
    The faint scream of the astounded Mrs. Truefitt brought her daughter
    hastily into the passage.  Mr. Catesby's idea was ever to do a thing
    thoroughly, and, relinquishing Mrs. Truefitt, he kissed Prudence with all
    the ardour which a seven-years' absence might be supposed to engender in
    the heart of a devoted brother.  In return he received a box on the ears
    which made his head ring.
</p>
<p>
    "He's been drinking," gasped the dismayed Mrs. Truefitt.
</p>
<p>
    "Don't you know me, mother?"  inquired Mr. Richard Catesby, in grievous
    astonishment.
</p>
<p>
    "He's mad," said her daughter.
</p>
<p>
    "Am I so altered that you don't know me, Prudence?"  inquired Mr.
    Catesby; with pathos.  "Don't you know your Fred?"
</p>
<p>
    "Go out," said Mrs. Truefitt, recovering; "go out at once."
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Catesby looked from one to the other in consternation.
</p>
<p>
    "I know I've altered," he said, at last, "but I'd no idea&mdash;"
</p>
<p>
    "If you don't go out at once I'll send for the police," said the elder
    woman, sharply.  "Prudence, scream!"
</p>
<p>
    "I'm not going to scream," said Prudence, eyeing the intruder with great
    composure.  "I'm not afraid of him."
</p>
<p>
    Despite her reluctance to have a scene&mdash;a thing which was strongly
    opposed to the traditions of Bashford's Lane&mdash;Mrs. Truefitt had got as
    far as the doorstep in search of assistance, when a sudden terrible
    thought occurred to her: Fred was dead, and the visitor had hit upon this
    extraordinary fashion of breaking the news gently.
</p>
<p>
    "Come into the parlour," she said, faintly.
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Catesby, suppressing his surprise, followed her into the room.
    Prudence, her fine figure erect and her large eyes meeting his steadily,
    took up a position by the side of her mother.
</p>
<p>
    "You have brought bad news?" inquired the latter.
</p>
<p>
    "No, mother," said Mr. Catesby, simply, "only myself, that's all."
</p>
<p>
    Mrs. Truefitt made a gesture of impatience, and her daughter, watching
    him closely, tried to remember something she had once read about
    detecting insanity by the expression of the eyes.  Those of Mr. Catesby
    were blue, and the only expression in them at the present moment was one
    of tender and respectful admiration.
</p>
<p>
    "When did you see Fred last?"  inquired Mrs. Truefitt, making another
    effort.
</p>
<p>
    "Mother," said Mr. Catesby, with great pathos, "don't you know me?"
</p>
<p>
    "He has brought bad news of Fred," said Mrs. Truefitt, turning to her
    daughter; "I am sure he has."
</p>
<p>
    "I don't understand you," said Mr. Catesby, with a bewildered glance from
    one to the other.  "I am Fred.  Am I much changed?  You look the same as
    you always did, and it seems only yesterday since I kissed Prudence
    good-bye at the docks.  You were crying, Prudence."
</p>
<p>
    Miss Truefitt made no reply; she gazed at him unflinchingly and then bent
    toward her mother.
</p>
<p>
    "He is mad," she whispered; "we must try and get him out quietly.  Don't
    contradict him."
</p>
<p>
    "Keep close to me," said Mrs. Truefitt, who had a great horror of the
    insane.  "If he turns violent open the window and scream.  I thought he
    had brought bad news of Fred.  How did he know about him?"
</p>
<p>
    Her daughter shook her head and gazed curiously at their afflicted
    visitor.  She put his age down at twenty-five, and she could not help
    thinking it a pity that so good-looking a young man should have lost his
    wits.
</p>
<p>
    "Bade Prudence good-bye at the docks," continued Mr. Catesby, dreamily.
    "You drew me behind a pile of luggage, Prudence, and put your head on my
    shoulder.  I have thought of it ever since."
</p>
<p>
    Miss Truefitt did not deny it, but she bit her lips, and shot a sharp
    glance at him.  She began to think that her pity was uncalled-for.
</p>
<p>
    "I'm just going as far as the corner."
</p>
<p>
    "Tell me all that's happened since I've been away," said Mr. Catesby.
</p>
<p>
    Mrs. Truefitt turned to her daughter and whispered.  It might have been
    merely the effect of a guilty conscience, but the visitor thought that he
    caught the word "policeman."
</p>
<p>
    "I'm just going as far as the corner," said Mrs. Truefitt, rising, and
    crossing hastily to the door.

<!--IMAGE END-->
<p>
    The young man nodded affectionately and sat in doubtful consideration as
    the front door closed behind her.  "Where is mother going?"  he asked, in
    a voice which betrayed a little pardonable anxiety.
</p>
<p>
    "Not far, I hope," said Prudence.
</p>
<p>
    "I really think," said Mr. Catesby, rising&mdash;"I really think that I had
    better go after her.  At her age&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>
<p>
    He walked into the small passage and put his hand on the latch.
    Prudence, now quite certain of his sanity, felt sorely reluctant to let
    such impudence go unpunished.
</p>
<p>
    "Are you going?" she inquired.
</p>
<p>
    "I think I'd better," said Mr. Catesby, gravely.  "Dear mother&mdash;"
</p>
<p>
    "You're afraid," said the girl, calmly.
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Catesby coloured and his buoyancy failed him.  He felt a little bit
    cheap.
</p>
<p>
    "You are brave enough with two women," continued the girl, disdainfully;
    "but you had better go if you're afraid."
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Catesby regarded the temptress uneasily.  "Would you like me to
    stay?" he asked.
</p>
<p>
    "I?" said Miss Truefitt, tossing her head.  "No, I don't want you.
    Besides, you're frightened."
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Catesby turned, and with a firm step made his way back to the room;
    Prudence, with a half-smile, took a chair near the door and regarded her
    prisoner with unholy triumph.
</p>
<p>
    "I shouldn't like to be in your shoes," she said, agreeably; "mother has
    gone for a policeman."
</p>
<p>
    "Bless her," said Mr. Catesby, fervently.  "What had we better say to him
    when he comes?"
</p>
<p>
    "You'll be locked up," said Prudence; "and it will serve you right for
    your bad behaviour."
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Catesby sighed.  "It's the heart," he said, gravely.  "I'm not to
    blame, really.  I saw you standing in the window, and I could see at once
    that you were beautiful, and good, and kind."
</p>
<p>
    "I never heard of such impudence," continued Miss Truefitt.
</p>
<p>
    "I surprised myself," admitted Mr. Catesby.  "In the usual way I am very
    quiet and well-behaved, not to say shy."
</p>
<p>
    Miss Truefitt looked at him scornfully.  "I think that you had better
    stop your nonsense and go," she remarked.
</p>
<p>
    "Don't you want me to be punished?" inquired the other, in a soft voice.
</p>
<p>
    "I think that you had better go while you can," said the girl, and at
    that moment there was a heavy knock at the front-door.  Mr. Catesby,
    despite his assurance, changed colour; the girl eyed him in perplexity.
    Then she opened the small folding-doors at the back of the room.
</p>
<p>
    "You're only&mdash;stupid," she whispered.  "Quick!  Go in there.  I'll say
    you've gone.  Keep quiet, and I'll let you out by-and-by."
</p>
<p>
    She pushed him in and closed the doors.  From his hiding-place he heard
    an animated conversation at the street-door and minute particulars as to
    the time which had elapsed since his departure and the direction he had
    taken.
</p>
<p>
    "I never heard such impudence," said Mrs. Truefitt, going into the
    front-room and sinking into a chair after the constable had taken his
    departure.  "I don't believe he was mad."
</p>
<p>
    "Only a little weak in the head, I think," said Prudence, in a clear
    voice.  "He was very frightened after you had gone; I don't think he will
    trouble us again."
</p>
<p>
    "He'd better not," said Mrs. Truefitt, sharply.  "I never heard of such a
    thing&mdash;never."
</p>
<p>
    She continued to grumble, while Prudence, in a low voice, endeavoured to
    soothe her.  Her efforts were evidently successful, as the prisoner was,
    after a time, surprised to hear the older woman laugh&mdash;at first gently,
    and then with so much enjoyment that her daughter was at some pains to
    restrain her.  He sat in patience until evening deepened into night, and
    a line of light beneath the folding-doors announced the lighting of the
    lamp in the front-room.  By a pleasant clatter of crockery he became
    aware that they were at supper, and he pricked up his ears as Prudence
    made another reference to him.
</p>
<p>
    "If he comes to-morrow night while you are out I sha'n't open the door,"
    she said.  "You'll be back by nine, I suppose."
</p>
<p>
    Mrs. Truefitt assented.
</p>
<p>
    "And you won't be leaving before seven," continued Prudence.  "I shall be
    all right."
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Catesby's face glowed and his eyes grew tender; Prudence was as
    clever as she was beautiful.  The delicacy with which she had intimated
    the fact of the unconscious Mrs. Truefitt's absence on the following
    evening was beyond all praise.  The only depressing thought was that such
    resourcefulness savoured of practice.
</p>
<p>
    He sat in the darkness for so long that even the proximity of Prudence
    was not sufficient amends for the monotony of it, and it was not until
    past ten o'clock that the folding-doors were opened and he stood blinking
    at the girl in the glare of the lamp.
</p>
<p>
    "Quick!"  she whispered.
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Catesby stepped into the lighted room.
</p>
<p>
    "The front-door is open," whispered Prudence.  "Make haste.  I'll close
    it."
</p>
<p>
    She followed him to the door; he made an ineffectual attempt to seize her
    hand, and the next moment was pushed gently outside and the door closed
    behind him.  He stood a moment gazing at the house, and then hastened
    back to his ship.
</p>
<p>
    "Seven to-morrow," he murmured; "seven to-morrow.  After all, there's
    nothing pays in this world like cheek&mdash;nothing."
</p>
<p>
    He slept soundly that night, though the things that the second-engineer
    said to him about wasting a hard-working man's evening would have lain
    heavy on the conscience of a more scrupulous man.  The only thing that
    troubled him was the manifest intention of his friend not to let him slip
    through his fingers on the following evening.  At last, in sheer despair
    at his inability to shake him off, he had to tell him that he had an
    appointment with a lady.
</p>
<p>
    "Well, I'll come, too," said the other, glowering at him.  "It's very
    like she'll have a friend with her; they generally do."
</p>
<p>
    "I'll run round and tell her," said Catesby.  "I'd have arranged it
    before, only I thought you didn't care about that sort of thing."
</p>
<p>
    "Female society is softening," said the second-engineer.  "I'll go and
    put on a clean collar."

<!--IMAGE END-->
<p>
    Catesby watched him into his cabin and then, though it still wanted an
    hour to seven, hastily quitted the ship and secreted himself in the
    private bar of the Beehive.
</p>
<p>
    He waited there until a quarter past seven, and then, adjusting his tie
    for about the tenth time that evening in the glass behind the bar,
    sallied out in the direction of No. 5.
</p>
<p>
    He knocked lightly, and waited.  There was no response, and he knocked
    again.  When the fourth knock brought no response, his heart sank within
    him and he indulged in vain speculations as to the reasons for this
    unexpected hitch in the programme.  He knocked again, and then the door
    opened suddenly and Prudence, with a little cry of surprise and dismay,
    backed into the passage.
</p>
<p>
    "You!"  she said, regarding him with large eyes.  Mr. Catesby bowed
    tenderly, and passing in closed the door behind him.
</p>
<p>
    "I wanted to thank you for your kindness last night," he said, humbly.
</p>
<p>
    "Very well," said Prudence; "good-bye."
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Catesby smiled.  "It'll take me a long time to thank you as I ought
    to thank you," he murmured.  "And then I want to apologise; that'll take
    time, too."
</p>
<p>
    "You had better go," said Prudence, severely; "kindness is thrown away
    upon you.  I ought to have let you be punished."
</p>
<p>
    "You are too good and kind," said the other, drifting by easy stages into
    the parlour.
</p>
<p>
    Miss Truefitt made no reply, but following him into the room seated
    herself in an easy-chair and sat coldly watchful.
</p>
<p>
    "How do you know what I am?" she inquired.
</p>
<p>
    "Your face tells me," said the infatuated Richard.  "I hope you will
    forgive me for my rudeness last night.  It was all done on the spur of
    the moment."
</p>
<p>
    "I am glad you are sorry," said the girl, softening.
</p>
<p>
    "All the same, if I hadn't done it," pursued Mr. Catesby, "I shouldn't be
    sitting here talking to you now."
</p>
<p>
    Miss Truefitt raised her eyes to his, and then lowered them modestly to
    the ground.  "That is true," she said, quietly.
</p>
<p>
    "And I would sooner be sitting here than any-where," pursued Catesby.
    "That is," he added, rising, and taking a chair by her side, "except
    here."
</p>
<p>
    Miss Truefitt appeared to tremble, and made as though to rise.  Then she
    sat still and took a gentle peep at Mr. Catesby from the corner of her
    eye.
</p>
<p>
    "I hope that you are not sorry that I am here?"  said that gentleman.
</p>
<p>
    Miss Truefitt hesitated.  "No," she said, at last.
</p>
<p>
    "Are you&mdash;are you glad?" asked the modest Richard.
</p>
<p>
    Miss Truefitt averted her eyes altogether.  "Yes," she said, faintly.
</p>
<p>
    A strange feeling of solemnity came over the triumphant Richard.  He took
    the hand nearest to him and pressed it gently.
</p>
<p>
    "I&mdash;I can hardly believe in my good luck," he murmured.
</p>
<p>
    "Good luck?" said Prudence, innocently.
</p>
<p>
    "Isn't it good luck to hear you say that you are glad I'm here?"  said
    Catesby.
</p>
<p>
    "You're the best judge of that," said the girl, withdrawing her hand.
    "It doesn't seem to me much to be pleased about."
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Catesby eyed her in perplexity, and was about to address another
    tender remark to her when she was overcome by a slight fit of coughing.
    At the same moment he started at the sound of a shuffling footstep in the
    passage.  Somebody tapped at the door.
</p>
<p>
    "Yes?" said Prudence.
</p>
<p>
    "Can't find the knife-powder, miss," said a harsh voice.  The door was
    pushed open and disclosed a tall, bony woman of about forty.  Her red
    arms were bare to the elbow, and she betrayed several evidences of a long
    and arduous day's charing.
</p>
<p>
    "It's in the cupboard," said Prudence.  "Why, what's the matter, Mrs.
    Porter?"
</p>
<p>
    Mrs. Porter made no reply.  Her mouth was wide open and she was gazing
    with starting eyeballs at Mr. Catesby.
</p>
<p>
    "Joe!" she said, in a hoarse whisper.  "Joe!"
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Catesby gazed at her in chilling silence.  Miss Truefitt, with an air
    of great surprise, glanced from one to the other.
</p>
<p>
    "Joe!" said Mrs. Porter again.  "Ain't you goin' to speak to me?"
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Catesby continued to gaze at her in speechless astonishment.  She
    skipped clumsily round the table and stood before him with her hands
    clasped.
</p>
<p>
    "Where 'ave you been all this long time?"  she demanded, in a higher key.
</p>
<p>
    "You&mdash;you've made a mistake," said the bewildered Richard.
</p>
<p>
    "Mistake?"  wailed Mrs. Porter.  "Mistake!  Oh, where's your 'art?"
</p>
<p>
    Before he could get out of her way she flung her arms round the horrified
    young man's neck and em-braced him copiously.  Over her bony left
    shoulder the frantic Richard met the ecstatic gaze of Miss Truefitt, and,
    in a flash, he realised the trap into which he had fallen.
</p>
<p>
    "Mrs. Porter!" said Prudence.
</p>
<p>
    "It's my 'usband, miss," said the Amazon, reluctantly releasing the
    flushed and dishevelled Richard; "'e left me and my five eighteen months
    ago.  For eighteen months I 'aven't 'ad a sight of 'is blessed face."
</p>
<p>
    She lifted the hem of her apron to her face and broke into discordant
    weeping.
</p>
<p>
    "Don't cry," said Prudence, softly; "I'm sure he isn't worth it."
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Catesby looked at her wanly.  He was beyond further astonishment, and
    when Mrs. Truefitt entered the room with a laudable attempt to twist her
    features into an expression of surprise, he scarcely noticed her.
</p>
<p>
    "It's my Joe," said Mrs. Porter, simply.
</p>
<p>
    "Good gracious!" said Mrs. Truefitt.  "Well, you've got him now; take
    care he doesn't run away from you again."
</p>
<p>
    "I'll look after that, ma'am," said Mrs. Porter, with a glare at the
    startled Richard.

<p>
    "She's very forgiving," said Prudence.  "She kissed him just now."
</p>
<p>
    "Did she, though," said the admiring Mrs. Truefitt.  "I wish I'd been
    here."
</p>
<p>
    "I can do it agin, ma'am," said the obliging Mrs. Porter.
</p>
<p>
    "If you come near me again&mdash;" said the breathless Richard, stepping back
    a pace.
</p>
<p>
    "I shouldn't force his love," said Mrs. Truefitt; "it'll come back in
    time, I dare say."
</p>
<p>
    "I'm sure he's affectionate," said Prudence.
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Catesby eyed his tormentors in silence; the faces of Prudence and her
    mother betokened much innocent enjoyment, but the austerity of Mrs.
    Porter's visage was unrelaxed.
</p>
<p>
    "Better let bygones be bygones," said Mrs. Truefitt; "he'll be sorry
    by-and-by for all the trouble he has caused."
</p>
<p>
    "He'll be ashamed of himself&mdash;if you give him time," added Prudence.
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Catesby had heard enough; he took up his hat and crossed to the door.
</p>
<p>
    "Take care he doesn't run away from you again," repeated Mrs. Truefitt.
</p>
<p>
    "I'll see to that, ma'am," said Mrs. Porter, taking him by the arm.
    "Come along, Joe."
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Catesby attempted to shake her off, but in vain, and he ground his
    teeth as he realised the absurdity of his position.  A man he could have
    dealt with, but Mrs. Porter was invulnerable.  Sooner than walk down the
    road with her he preferred the sallies of the parlour.  He walked back to
    his old position by the fireplace, and stood gazing moodily at the floor.
</p>
<p>
    Mrs. Truefitt tired of the sport at last.  She wanted her supper, and
    with a significant glance at her daughter she beckoned the redoubtable
    and reluctant Mrs. Porter from the room.  Catesby heard the kitchen-door
    close behind them, but he made no move.  Prudence stood gazing at him in
    silence.
</p>
<p>
    "If you want to go," she said, at last, "now is your chance."
</p>
<p>
    Catesby followed her into the passage without a word, and waited quietly
    while she opened the door.  Still silent, he put on his hat and passed
    out into the darkening street.  He turned after a short distance for a
    last look at the house and, with a sudden sense of elation, saw that she
    was standing on the step.  He hesitated, and then walked slowly back.
</p>
<p>
    "Yes?"  said Prudence.
</p>
<p>
    "I should like to tell your mother that I am sorry," he said, in a low
    voice.
</p>
<p>
    "It is getting late," said the girl, softly; "but, if you really wish to
    tell her&mdash;Mrs. Porter will not be here to-morrow night."
</p>
<p>
    She stepped back into the house and the door closed behind her.

<h2>
    THE CHANGING NUMBERS
</h2>
<p>
    The tall clock in the corner of the small living-room had just struck
    eight as Mr. Samuel Gunnill came stealthily down the winding staircase
    and, opening the door at the foot, stepped with an appearance of great
    care and humility into the room.  He noticed with some anxiety that his
    daughter Selina was apparently engrossed in her task of attending to the
    plants in the window, and that no preparations whatever had been made for
    breakfast.

<p>
    Miss Gunnill's horticultural duties seemed interminable.  She snipped off
    dead leaves with painstaking precision, and administered water with the
    jealous care of a druggist compounding a prescription; then, with her
    back still toward him, she gave vent to a sigh far too intense in its
    nature to have reference to such trivialities as plants.  She repeated it
    twice, and at the second time Mr. Gunnill, almost without his knowledge,
    uttered a deprecatory cough.
</p>
<p>
    His daughter turned with alarming swiftness and, holding herself very
    upright, favoured him with a glance in which indignation and surprise
    were very fairly mingled.
</p>
<p>
    "That white one&mdash;that one at the end," said Mr. Gunnill, with an
    appearance of concentrated interest, "that's my fav'rite."
</p>
<p>
    Miss Gunnill put her hands together, and a look of infinite
    long-suffering came upon her face, but she made no reply.
</p>
<p>
    "Always has been," continued Mr. Gunnill, feverishly, "from a&mdash;from a
    cutting."
</p>
<p>
    "Bailed out," said Miss Gunnill, in a deep and thrilling voice; "bailed
    out at one o'clock in the morning, brought home singing loud enough for
    half-a-dozen, and then talking about flowers!"
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Gunnill coughed again.
</p>
<p>
    "I was dreaming," pursued Miss Gunnill, plaintively, "sleeping
    peacefully, when I was awoke by a horrible noise."
</p>
<p>
    "That couldn't ha' been me," protested her father.  "I was only a bit
    cheerful.  It was Benjamin Ely's birthday yesterday, and after we left
    the Lion they started singing, and I just hummed to keep 'em company.  I
    wasn't singing, mind you, only humming&mdash;when up comes that interfering
    Cooper and takes me off."
</p>
<p>
    Miss Gunnill shivered, and with her pretty cheek in her hand sat by the
    window the very picture of despondency.  "Why didn't he take the others?"
    she inquired.
</p>
<p>
    "Ah!" said Mr. Gunnill, with great emphasis, "that's what a lot more of
    us would like to know.  P'r'aps if you'd been more polite to Mrs. Cooper,
    instead o' putting it about that she looked young enough to be his
    mother, it wouldn't have happened."
</p>
<p>
    His daughter shook her head impatiently and, on Mr. Gunnill making an
    allusion to breakfast, expressed surprise that he had got the heart to
    eat any-thing.  Mr. Gunnill pressing the point, however, she arose and
    began to set the table, the undue care with which she smoothed out the
    creases of the table-cloth, and the mathematical exactness with which she
    placed the various articles, all being so many extra smarts in his wound.
    When she finally placed on the table enough food for a dozen people he
    began to show signs of a little spirit.
</p>
<p>
    "Ain't you going to have any?" he demanded, as Miss Gunnill resumed her
    seat by the window.
</p>
<p>
    "Me?" said the girl, with a shudder.  "Breakfast?  The disgrace is
    breakfast enough for me.  I couldn't eat a morsel; it would choke me."
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Gunnill eyed her over the rim of his teacup.  "I come down an hour
    ago," he said, casually, as he helped himself to some bacon.
</p>
<p>
    Miss Gunnill started despite herself.  "Oh!" she said, listlessly.
</p>
<p>
    "And I see you making a very good breakfast all by yourself in the
    kitchen," continued her father, in a voice not free from the taint of
    triumph.
</p>
<p>
    The discomfited Selina rose and stood regarding him; Mr. Gunnill, after a
    vain attempt to meet her gaze, busied himself with his meal.
</p>
<p>
    "The idea of watching every mouthful I eat!"  said Miss Gunnill,
    tragically; "the idea of complaining because I have some breakfast!  I'd
    never have believed it of you, never!  It's shameful!  Fancy grudging
    your own daughter the food she eats!"
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Gunnill eyed her in dismay.  In his confusion he had overestimated
    the capacity of his mouth, and he now strove in vain to reply to this
    shameful perversion of his meaning.  His daughter stood watching him with
    grief in one eye and calculation in the other, and, just as he had put
    himself into a position to exercise his rights of free speech, gave a
    pathetic sniff and walked out of the room.
</p>
<p>
    She stayed indoors all day, but the necessity of establishing his
    innocence took Mr. Gunnill out a great deal.  His neighbours, in the hope
    of further excitement, warmly pressed him to go to prison rather than pay
    a fine, and instanced the example of an officer in the Salvation Army,
    who, in very different circumstances, had elected to take that course.
    Mr. Gunnill assured them that only his known antipathy to the army, and
    the fear of being regarded as one of its followers, prevented him from
    doing so.  He paid instead a fine of ten shillings, and after listening
    to a sermon, in which his silver hairs served as the text, was permitted
    to depart.  His feeling against Police-constable Cooper increased with
    the passing of the days.  The constable watched him with the air of a
    proprietor, and Mrs. Cooper's remark that "her husband had had his eye
    upon him for a long time, and that he had better be careful for the
    future," was faithfully retailed to him within half an hour of its
    utterance.  Convivial friends counted his cups for him; teetotal friends
    more than hinted that Cooper was in the employ of his good angel.

<p>
    Miss Gunnill's two principal admirers had an arduous task to perform.
    They had to attribute Mr. Gunnill's disaster to the vindictiveness of
    Cooper, and at the same time to agree with his daughter that it served
    him right.  Between father and daughter they had a difficult time, Mr.
    Gunnill's sensitiveness having been much heightened by his troubles.
</p>
<p>
    "Cooper ought not to have taken you," said Herbert Sims for the fiftieth
    time.
</p>
<p>
    "He must ha' seen you like it dozens o' times before," said Ted Drill,
    who, in his determination not to be outdone by Mr. Sims, was not
    displaying his usual judgment.  "Why didn't he take you then?  That's
    what you ought to have asked the magistrate."
</p>
<p>
    "I don't understand you," said Mr. Gunnill, with an air of cold dignity.
</p>
<p>
    "Why," said Mr. Drill, "what I mean is&mdash;look at that night, for instance,
    when&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>
<p>
    He broke off suddenly, even his enthusiasm not being proof against the
    extraordinary contortions of visage in which Mr. Gunnill was indulging.
</p>
<p>
    "When?"  prompted Selina and Mr. Sims together.  Mr. Gunnill, after first
    daring him with his eye, followed suit.
</p>
<p>
    "That night at the Crown," said Mr. Drill, awkwardly.  "You know; when
    you thought that Joe Baggs was the landlord.  You tell 'em; you tell it
    best.  I've roared over it."
</p>
<p>
    "I don't know what you're driving at," said the harassed Mr. Gunnill,
    bitterly.
</p>
<p>
    "H'm!"  said Mr. Drill, with a weak laugh.  "I've been mixing you up with
    somebody else."
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Gunnill, obviously relieved, said that he ought to be more careful,
    and pointed out, with some feeling, that a lot of mischief was caused
    that way.
</p>
<p>
    "Cooper wants a lesson, that's what he wants," said Mr. Sims, valiantly.
    "He'll get his head broke one of these days."
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Gunnill acquiesced.  "I remember when I was on the <i>Peewit,</i>" he
    said, musingly, "one time when we were lying at Cardiff, there was a
    policeman there run one of our chaps in, and two nights afterward another
    of our chaps pushed the policeman down in the mud and ran off with his
    staff and his helmet."
</p>
<p>
    Miss Gunnill's eyes glistened.  "What happened?" she inquired.
</p>
<p>
    "He had to leave the force," replied her father; "he couldn't stand the
    disgrace of it.  The chap that pushed him over was quite a little chap,
    too.  About the size of Herbert here."
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Sims started.
</p>
<p>
    "Very much like him in face, too," pursued Mr. Gunnill; "daring chap he
    was."
</p>
<p>
    Miss Gunnill sighed.  "I wish he lived in Little-stow," she said, slowly.
    "I'd give anything to take that horrid Mrs. Cooper down a bit.  Cooper
    would be the laughing-stock of the town."
</p>
<p>
    Messrs. Sims and Drill looked unhappy.  It was hard to have to affect an
    attitude of indifference in the face of Miss Gunnill's lawless yearnings;
    to stand before her as respectable and law-abiding cravens.  Her eyes,
    large and sorrowful; dwelt on them both.
</p>
<p>
    "If I&mdash;I only get a chance at Cooper!" murmured Mr. Sims, vaguely.
</p>
<p>
    To his surprise, Mr. Gunnill started up from his chair and, gripping his
    hand, shook it fervently.  He looked round, and Selina was regarding him
    with a glance so tender that he lost his head completely.  Before he had
    recovered he had pledged himself to lay the helmet and truncheon of the
    redoubtable Mr. Cooper at the feet of Miss Gunnill; exact date not
    specified.
</p>
<p>
    "Of course, I shall have to wait my opportunity," he said, at last.
</p>
<p>
    "You wait as long as you like, my boy," said the thoughtless Mr. Gunnill.
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Sims thanked him.
</p>
<p>
    "Wait till Cooper's an old man," urged Mr. Drill.
</p>
<p>
    Miss Gunnill, secretly disappointed at the lack of boldness and devotion
    on the part of the latter gentleman, eyed his stalwart frame indignantly
    and accused him of trying to make Mr. Sims as timid as himself.  She
    turned to the valiant Sims and made herself so agreeable to that daring
    blade that Mr. Drill, a prey to violent jealousy, bade the company a curt
    good-night and withdrew.
</p>
<p>
    He stayed away for nearly a week, and then one evening as he approached
    the house, carrying a carpet-bag, he saw the door just opening to admit
    the fortunate Herbert.  He quickened his pace and arrived just in time to
    follow him in.  Mr. Sims, who bore under his arm a brown-paper parcel,
    seemed somewhat embarrassed at seeing him, and after a brief greeting
    walked into the room, and with a triumphant glance at Mr. Gunnill and
    Selina placed his burden on the table.
</p>

<p>
    "You&mdash;you ain't got it?"  said Mr. Gunnill, leaning forward.
</p>
<p>
    "How foolish of you to run such a risk!"  said Selina.
</p>
<p>
    "I brought it for Miss Gunnill," said the young man, simply.  He
    unfastened the parcel, and to the astonishment of all present revealed a
    policeman's helmet and a short boxwood truncheon.
</p>
<p>
    "You&mdash;you're a wonder," said the gloating Mr. Gunnill.  "Look at it,
    Ted!"
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Drill was looking at it; it may be doubted whether the head of Mr.
    Cooper itself could have caused him more astonishment.  Then his eyes
    sought those of Mr. Sims, but that gentleman was gazing tenderly at the
    gratified but shocked Selina.
</p>
<p>
    "How ever did you do it?"  inquired Mr. Gunnill.
</p>
<p>
    "Came behind him and threw him down," said Mr. Sims, nonchalantly.  "He
    was that scared I believe I could have taken his boots as well if I'd
    wanted them."
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Gunnill patted him on the back.  "I fancy I can see him running
    bare-headed through the town calling for help," he said, smiling.
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Sims shook his head.  "Like as not it'll be kept quiet for the credit
    of the force," he said, slowly, "unless, of course, they discover who did
    it."
</p>
<p>
    A slight shade fell on the good-humoured countenance of Mr. Gunnill, but
    it was chased away almost immediately by Sims reminding him of the chaff
    of Cooper's brother-constables.
</p>
<p>
    "And you might take the others away," said Mr. Gunnill, brightening; "you
    might keep on doing it."
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Sims said doubtfully that he might, but pointed out that Cooper would
    probably be on his guard for the future.
</p>
<p>
    "Yes, you've done your share," said Miss Gunnill, with a half-glance at
    Mr. Drill, who was still gazing in a bewildered fashion at the trophies.
    "You can come into the kitchen and help me draw some beer if you like."
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Sims followed her joyfully, and reaching down a jug for her watched
    her tenderly as she drew the beer.  All women love valour, but Miss
    Gunnill, gazing sadly at the slight figure of Mr. Sims, could not help
    wishing that Mr. Drill possessed a little of his spirit.

<p>
    She had just finished her task when a tremendous bumping noise was heard
    in the living-room, and the plates on the dresser were nearly shaken off
    their shelves.
</p>
<p>
    "What's that?" she cried.
</p>
<p>
    They ran to the room and stood aghast in the doorway at the spectacle of
    Mr. Gunnill, with his clenched fists held tightly by his side, bounding
    into the air with all the grace of a trained acrobat, while Mr. Drill
    encouraged him from an easy-chair.  Mr. Gunnill smiled broadly as he met
    their astonished gaze, and with a final bound kicked something along the
    floor and subsided into his seat panting.
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Sims, suddenly enlightened, uttered a cry of dismay and, darting
    under the table, picked up what had once been a policeman's helmet.  Then
    he snatched a partially consumed truncheon from the fire, and stood white
    and trembling before the astonished Mr. Gunnill.
</p>
<p>
    "What's the matter?" inquired the latter.  "You&mdash;you've spoilt 'em,"
    gasped Mr. Sims.  "What of it?"  said Mr. Gunnill, staring.
</p>
<p>
    "I was&mdash;going to take 'em away," stammered Mr. Sims.
</p>
<p>
    "Well, they'll be easier to carry now," said Mr. Drill, simply.
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Sims glanced at him sharply, and then, to the extreme astonishment of
    Mr. Gunnill, snatched up the relics and, wrapping them up in the paper,
    dashed out of the house.  Mr. Gunnill turned a look of blank inquiry upon
    Mr. Drill.
</p>
<p>
    "It wasn't Cooper's number on the helmet," said that gentleman.
</p>
<p>
    "Eh?" shouted Mr. Gunnill.
</p>
<p>
    "How do you know?" inquired Selina.
</p>
<p>
    "I just happened to notice," replied Mr. Drill.  He reached down as
    though to take up the carpet-bag which he had placed by the side of his
    chair, and then, apparently thinking better of it, leaned back in his
    seat and eyed Mr. Gunnill.
</p>
<p>
    "Do you mean to tell me," said the latter, "that he's been and upset the
    wrong man?"
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Drill shook his head.  "That's the puzzle," he said, softly.
</p>
<p>
    He smiled over at Miss Gunnill, but that young lady, who found him
    somewhat mysterious, looked away and frowned.  Her father sat and
    exhausted conjecture, his final conclusion being that Mr. Sims had
    attacked the first policeman that had come in his way and was now
    suffering the agonies of remorse.
</p>
<p>
    He raised his head sharply at the sound of hurried footsteps outside.
    There was a smart rap at the street door, then the handle was turned, and
    the next moment, to the dismay of all present, the red and angry face of
    one of Mr. Cooper's brother-constables was thrust into the room.
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Gunnill gazed at it in helpless fascination.  The body of the
    constable garbed in plain clothes followed the face and, standing before
    him in a menacing fashion, held out a broken helmet and staff.
</p>
<p>
    "Have you seen these afore?" he inquired, in a terrible voice.
</p>
<p>
    "No," said Mr. Gunnill, with an attempt at surprise.  "What are they?"
</p>
<p>
    "I'll tell you what they are," said Police-constable Jenkins,
    ferociously; "they're my helmet and truncheon.  You've been spoiling His
    Majesty's property, and you'll be locked up."
</p>
<p>
    "Yours?" said the astonished Mr. Gunnill.
</p>
<p>
    "I lent 'em to young Sims, just for a joke," said the constable.  "I felt
    all along I was doing a silly thing."
</p>
<p>
    "It's no joke," said Mr. Gunnill, severely.  "I'll tell young Herbert
    what I think of him trying to deceive me like that."
</p>
<p>
    "Never mind about deceiving," interrupted the constable.  "What are you
    going to do about it?"
</p>
<p>
    "What are you?"  inquired Mr. Gunnill, hardily.  "It seems to me it's
    between you and him; you'll very likely be dismissed from the force, and
    all through trying to deceive.  I wash my hands of it."
</p>
<p>
    "You'd no business to lend it," said Drill, interrupting the constable's
    indignant retort; "especially for Sims to pretend that he had stolen it
    from Cooper.  It's a roundabout sort of thing, but you can't tell of Mr.
    Gunnill without getting into trouble yourself."
</p>
<p>
    "I shall have to put up with that," said the constable, desperately;
    "it's got to be explained.  It's my day-helmet, too, and the night one's
    as shabby as can be.  Twenty years in the force and never a mark against
    my name till now."
</p>
<p>
    "If you'd only keep quiet a bit instead of talking so much," said Mr.
    Drill, who had been doing some hard thinking, "I might be able to help
    you, p'r'aps."
</p>
<p>
    "How?" inquired the constable.
</p>
<p>
    "Help him if you can, Ted," said Mr. Gunnill, eagerly; "we ought all to
    help others when we get a chance."
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Drill sat bolt upright and looked very wise.
</p>
<p>
    He took the smashed helmet from the table and examined it carefully.  It
    was broken in at least half-a-dozen places, and he laboured in vain to
    push it into shape.  He might as well have tried to make a silk hat out
    of a concertina.  The only thing that had escaped injury was the metal
    plate with the number.
</p>
<p>
    "Why don't you mend it?"  he inquired, at last.
</p>
<p>
    "Mend it?" shouted the incensed Mr. Jenkins.  "Why don't you?"
</p>
<p>
    "I think I could," said Mr. Drill, slowly; "give me half an hour in the
    kitchen and I'll try."
</p>
<p>
    "Have as long as you like," said Mr. Gunnill.
</p>
<p>
    "And I shall want some glue, and Miss Gunnill, and some tin-tacks," said
    Drill.
</p>
<p>
    "What do you want me for?" inquired Selina.
</p>
<p>
    "To hold the things for me," replied Mr. Drill.
</p>
<p>
    Miss Gunnill tossed her head, but after a little demur consented; and
    Drill, ignoring the impatience of the constable, picked up his bag and
    led the way into the kitchen.  Messrs. Gunnill and Jenkins, left behind
    in the living-room, sought for some neutral topic of discourse, but in
    vain; conversation would revolve round hard labour and lost pensions.
    From the kitchen came sounds of hammering, then a loud "Ooh!" from Miss
    Gunnill, followed by a burst of laughter and a clapping of hands.  Mr.
    Jenkins shifted in his seat and exchanged glances with Mr. Gunnill.

<p>
    "He's a clever fellow," said that gentleman, hopefully.  "You should hear
    him imitate a canary; life-like it is."
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Jenkins was about to make a hasty and obvious rejoinder, when the
    kitchen door opened and Selina emerged, followed by Drill.  The snarl
    which the constable had prepared died away in a murmur of astonishment as
    he took the helmet.  It looked as good as ever.
</p>
<p>
    He turned it over and over in amaze, and looked in vain for any signs of
    the disastrous cracks.  It was stiff and upright.  He looked at the
    number: it was his own.  His eyes round with astonishment he tried it on,
    and then his face relaxed.
</p>
<p>
    "It don't fit as well as it did," he said.
</p>
<p>
    "Well, upon my word, some people are never satisfied," said the indignant
    Drill.  "There isn't another man in England could have done it better."
</p>
<p>
    "I'm not grumbling," said the constable, hastily; "it's a wonderful piece
    o' work.  Wonderful!  I can't even see where it was broke.  How on earth
    did you do it?"
</p>
<p>
    Drill shook his head.  "It's a secret process," he said, slowly.  "I
    might want to go into the hat trade some day, and I'm not going to give
    things away."
</p>
<p>
    "Quite right," said Mr. Jenkins.  "Still&mdash;well, it's a marvel, that's
    what it is; a fair marvel.  If you take my advice you'll go in the hat
    trade to-morrow, my lad."
</p>
<p>
    "I'm not surprised," said Mr. Gunnill, whose face as he spoke was a map
    of astonishment.  "Not a bit.  I've seen him do more surprising things
    than that.  Have a go at the staff now, Teddy."
</p>
<p>
    "I'll see about it," said Mr. Drill, modestly.  "I can't do
    impossibilities.  You leave it here, Mr. Jenkins, and we'll talk about it
    later on."
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Jenkins, still marvelling over his helmet, assented, and, after
    another reference to the possibilities in the hat trade to a man with a
    born gift for repairs, wrapped his property in a piece of newspaper and
    departed, whistling.
</p>
<p>
    "Ted," said Mr. Gunnill, impressively, as he sank into his chair with a
    sigh of relief.  "How you done it I don't know.  It's a surprise even to
    me."
</p>
<p>
    "He is very clever," said Selina, with a kind smile
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Drill turned pale, and then, somewhat emboldened by praise from such
    a quarter, dropped into a chair by her side and began to talk in low
    tones.  The grateful Mr. Gunnill, more relieved than he cared to confess,
    thoughtfully closed his eyes.
</p>
<p>
    "I didn't think all along that you'd let Herbert outdo you," said Selina.
</p>
<p>
    "I want to outdo him," said Mr. Drill, in a voice of much meaning.
</p>
<p>
    Miss Gunnill cast down her eyes and Mr. Drill had just plucked up
    sufficient courage to take her hand when footsteps stopped at the house,
    the handle of the door was turned, and, for the second time that evening,
    the inflamed visage of Mr. Jenkins confronted the company.
</p>
<p>
    "Don't tell me it's a failure," said Mr. Gunnill, starting from his
    chair.  "You must have been handling it roughly.  It was as good as new
    when you took it away."
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Jenkins waved him away and fixed his eyes upon Drill.
</p>
<p>
    "You think you're mighty clever, I dare say," he said, grimly; "but I can
    put two and two together.  I've just heard of it."
</p>
<p>
    "Heard of two and two?" said Drill, looking puzzled.
</p>
<p>
    "I don't want any of your nonsense," said Mr. Jenkins.  "I'm not on duty
    now, but I warn you not to say anything that may be used against you."
</p>
<p>
    "I never do," said Mr. Drill, piously.
</p>
<p>
    "Somebody threw a handful o' flour in poor Cooper's face a couple of
    hours ago," said Mr. Jenkins, watching him closely, "and while he was
    getting it out of his eyes they upset him and made off with his helmet
    and truncheon.  I just met Brown and he says Cooper's been going on like
    a madman."
</p>
<p>
    "By Jove! it's a good job I mended your helmet for you," said Mr. Drill,
    "or else they might have suspected you."
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Jenkins stared at him.  "I know who did do it," he said,
    significantly.
</p>
<p>
    "Herbert Sims?" guessed Mr. Drill, in a stage whisper.
</p>
<p>
    "You'll be one o' the first to know," said Mr. Jenkins, darkly; "he'll be
    arrested to-morrow.  Fancy the impudence of it!  It's shocking."
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Drill whistled.  "Nell, don't let that little affair o' yours with
    Sims be known," he said, quietly.  "Have that kept quiet&mdash;if you can."
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Jenkins started as though he had been stung.  In the joy of a case he
    had overlooked one or two things.  He turned and regarded the young man
    wistfully.
</p>
<p>
    "Don't call on me as a witness, that's all," continued Mr. Drill.  "I
    never was a mischief-maker, and I shouldn't like to have to tell how you
    lent your helmet to Sims so that he could pretend he had knocked Cooper
    down and taken it from him."

<p>
    "Wouldn't look at all well," said Mr. Gunnill, nodding his head sagely.
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Jenkins breathed hard and looked from one to the other.  It was plain
    that it was no good reminding them that he had not had a case for five
    years.
</p>
<p>
    "When I say that I know who did it," he said, slowly, "I mean that I have
    my suspicions."
</p>
<p>
    "Don't call on me as a witness, that's all,' continued Mr. Drill."
</p>
<p>
    "Ah," said Mr. Drill, "that's a very different thing."
</p>
<p>
    "Nothing like the same," said Mr. Gunnill, pouring the constable a glass
    of ale.
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Jenkins drank it and smacked his lips feebly.
</p>
<p>
    "Sims needn't know anything about that helmet being repaired," he said at
    last.
</p>
<p>
    "Certainly not," said everybody.
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Jenkins sighed and turned to Drill.
</p>
<p>
    "It's no good spoiling the ship for a ha'porth o' tar," he said, with a
    faint suspicion of a wink.  "No," said Drill, looking puzzled.
</p>
<p>
    "Anything that's worth doing at all is worth doing well," continued the
    constable, "and while I'm drinking another glass with Mr. Gunnill here,
    suppose you go into the kitchen with that useful bag o' yours and finish
    repairing my truncheon?"

<h2>
    THE PERSECUTION OF BOB PRETTY
</h2>
<p>
    The old man sat on his accustomed bench outside the Cauliflower.  A
    generous measure of beer stood in a blue and white jug by his elbow, and
    little wisps of smoke curled slowly upward from the bowl of his
    churchwarden pipe.  The knapsacks of two young men lay where they were
    flung on the table, and the owners, taking a noon-tide rest, turned a
    polite, if bored, ear to the reminiscences of grateful old age.
</p>
<p>
    Poaching, said the old man, who had tried topics ranging from early
    turnips to horseshoeing&mdash;poaching ain't wot it used to be in these 'ere
    parts.  Nothing is like it used to be, poaching nor anything else; but
    that there man you might ha' noticed as went out about ten minutes ago
    and called me "Old Truthfulness" as 'e passed is the worst one I know.
    Bob Pretty 'is name is, and of all the sly, artful, deceiving men that
    ever lived in Claybury 'e is the worst&mdash;never did a honest day's work in
    'is life and never wanted the price of a glass of ale.

<!--IMAGE END-->
<p>
    Bob Pretty's worst time was just after old Squire Brown died.  The old
    squire couldn't afford to preserve much, but by-and-by a gentleman with
    plenty o' money, from London, named Rockett, took 'is place and things
    began to look up.  Pheasants was 'is favourites, and 'e spent no end o'
    money rearing of 'em, but anything that could be shot at suited 'im, too.
</p>
<p>
    He started by sneering at the little game that Squire Brown 'ad left, but
    all 'e could do didn't seem to make much difference; things disappeared
    in a most eggstrordinary way, and the keepers went pretty near crazy,
    while the things the squire said about Claybury and Claybury men was
    disgraceful.
</p>
<p>
    Everybody knew as it was Bob Pretty and one or two of 'is mates from
    other places, but they couldn't prove it.  They couldn't catch 'im nohow,
    and at last the squire 'ad two keepers set off to watch 'im by night and
    by day.
</p>
<p>
    Bob Pretty wouldn't believe it; he said 'e couldn't.  And even when it
    was pointed out to 'im that Keeper Lewis was follering of 'im he said
    that it just 'appened he was going the same way, that was all.  And
    sometimes 'e'd get up in the middle of the night and go for a fifteen-mile walk 'cos 'e'd got the toothache, and Mr. Lewis, who 'adn't got it,
    had to tag along arter 'im till he was fit to drop.  O' course, it was
    one keeper the less to look arter the game, and by-and-by the squire see
    that and took 'im off.
</p>
<p>
    All the same they kept a pretty close watch on Bob, and at last one
    arternoon they sprang out on 'im as he was walking past Gray's farm, and
    asked him wot it was he 'ad in his pockets.
</p>
<p>
    "That's my bisness, Mr. Lewis," ses Bob Pretty.
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Smith, the other keeper, passed 'is hands over Bob's coat and felt
    something soft and bulgy.
</p>
<p>
    "You take your 'ands off of me," ses Bob; "you don't know 'ow partikler I
    am."
</p>
<p>
    He jerked 'imself away, but they caught 'old of 'im agin, and Mr. Lewis
    put 'is hand in his inside pocket and pulled out two brace o' partridges.
</p>
<p>
    "You'll come along of us," he ses, catching 'im by the arm.
</p>
<p>
    "We've been looking for you a long time," ses Keeper Smith, "and it's a
    pleasure for us to 'ave your company."
</p>
<p>
    Bob Pretty said 'e wouldn't go, but they forced 'im along and took 'im
    all the way to Cudford, four miles off, so that Policeman White could
    lock 'im up for the night.  Mr. White was a'most as pleased as the
    keepers, and 'e warned Bob solemn not to speak becos all 'e said would be
    used agin 'im.
</p>
<p>
    "Never mind about that," ses Bob Pretty.  "I've got a clear conscience,
    and talking can't 'urt me.  I'm very glad to see you, Mr. White; if these
    two clever, experienced keepers hadn't brought me I should 'ave looked
    you up myself.  They've been and stole my partridges."
</p>
<p>
    Them as was standing round laughed, and even Policeman White couldn't
    'elp giving a little smile.
</p>
<p>
    "There's nothing to laugh at," ses Bob, 'olding his 'ead up.  "It's a
    fine thing when a working man&mdash;a 'ardworking man&mdash;can't take home a
    little game for 'is family without being stopped and robbed."
</p>
<p>
    "I s'pose they flew into your pocket?" ses Police-man White.
</p>
<p>
    "No, they didn't," ses Bob.  "I'm not going to tell any lies about it;
    I put 'em there.  The partridges in my inside coat-pocket and the bill in
    my waistcoat-pocket."
</p>
<p>
    "The bill?" ses Keeper Lewis, staring at 'im.
</p>
<p>
    "Yes, the bill," ses Bob Pretty, staring back at 'im; "the bill from Mr.
    Keen, the poulterer, at Wick-ham."
</p>
<p>
    He fetched it out of 'is pocket and showed it to Mr. White, and the
    keepers was like madmen a'most 'cos it was plain to see that Bob Pretty
    'ad been and bought them partridges just for to play a game on 'em.
</p>
<p>
    "I was curious to know wot they tasted like," he ses to the policeman.
    "Worst of it is, I don't s'pose my pore wife'll know 'ow to cook 'em."
</p>
<p>
    "You get off 'ome," ses Policeman White, staring at 'im.
</p>
<p>
    "But ain't I goin' to be locked up?"  ses Bob.  "'Ave I been brought all
    this way just to 'ave a little chat with a policeman I don't like."
</p>
<p>
    "You go 'ome," ses Policeman White, handing the partridges back to 'im.
</p>
<p>
    "All right," ses Bob, "and I may 'ave to call you to witness that these
    'ere two men laid hold o' me and tried to steal my partridges.  I shall
    go up and see my loryer about it."
</p>
<p>
    He walked off 'ome with his 'ead up as high as 'e could hold it, and the
    airs 'e used to give 'imself arter this was terrible for to behold.  He
    got 'is eldest boy to write a long letter to the squire about it, saying
    that 'e'd overlook it this time, but 'e couldn't promise for the future.
    Wot with Bob Pretty on one side and Squire Rockett on the other, them two
    keepers' lives was 'ardly worth living.
</p>
<p>
    Then the squire got a head-keeper named Cutts, a man as was said to know
    more about the ways of poachers than they did themselves.  He was said to
    'ave cleared out all the poachers for miles round the place 'e came from,
    and pheasants could walk into people's cottages and not be touched.
</p>
<p>
    He was a sharp-looking man, tall and thin, with screwed-up eyes and a
    little red beard.  The second day 'e came 'e was up here at this 'ere
    Cauliflower, having a pint o' beer and looking round at the chaps as he
    talked to the landlord.  The odd thing was that men who'd never taken a
    hare or a pheasant in their lives could 'ardly meet 'is eye, while Bob
    Pretty stared at 'im as if 'e was a wax-works.
</p>
<p>
    "I 'ear you 'ad a little poaching in these parts afore I came," ses Mr.
    Cutts to the landlord.
</p>
<p>
    "I think I 'ave 'eard something o' the kind," ses the landlord, staring
    over his 'ead with a far-away look in 'is eyes.
</p>
<p>
    "You won't hear of much more," ses the keeper.  "I've invented a new way
    of catching the dirty rascals; afore I came 'ere I caught all the
    poachers on three estates.  I clear 'em out just like a ferret clears
    out rats."
</p>
<p>
    "Sort o' man-trap?" ses the landlord.
</p>
<p>
    "Ah, that's tellings," ses Mr. Cutts.
</p>
<p>
    "Well, I 'ope you'll catch 'em here," ses Bob Pretty; "there's far too
    many of 'em about for my liking.  Far too many."
</p>
<p>
    "I shall 'ave 'em afore long," ses Mr. Cutts, nodding his 'ead.
</p>

<!--IMAGE END-->
<p>
    "Your good 'ealth," ses Bob Pretty, holding up 'is mug.  "We've been
    wanting a man like you for a long time."
</p>
<p>
    "I don't want any of your impidence, my man," ses the keeper.  "I've
    'eard about you, and nothing good either.  You be careful."
</p>
<p>
    "I am careful," ses Bob, winking at the others.  "I 'ope you'll catch all
    them low poaching chaps; they give the place a bad name, and I'm a'most
    afraid to go out arter dark for fear of meeting 'em."
</p>
<p>
    Peter Gubbins and Sam Jones began to laugh, but Bob Pretty got angry with
    'em and said he didn't see there was anything to laugh at.  He said that
    poaching was a disgrace to their native place, and instead o' laughing
    they ought to be thankful to Mr. Cutts for coming to do away with it all.
</p>
<p>
    "Any help I can give you shall be given cheerful," he ses to the keeper.
</p>
<p>
    "When I want your help I'll ask you for it," ses Mr. Cutts.
</p>
<p>
    "Thankee," ses Bob Pretty.  "I on'y 'ope I sha'n't get my face knocked
    about like yours 'as been, that's all; 'cos my wife's so partikler."
</p>
<p>
    "Wot d'ye mean?"  ses Mr. Cutts, turning on him.  "My face ain't been
    knocked about."
</p>
<p>
    "Oh, I beg your pardin," ses Bob; "I didn't know it was natural."
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Cutts went black in the face a'most and stared at Bob Pretty as if 'e
    was going to eat 'im, and Bob stared back, looking fust at the keeper's
    nose and then at 'is eyes and mouth, and then at 'is nose agin.
</p>
<p>
    "You'll know me agin, I s'pose?" ses Mr. Cutts, at last.
</p>
<p>
    "Yes," ses Bob, smiling; "I should know you a mile off&mdash;on the darkest
    night."
</p>
<p>
    "We shall see," ses Mr. Cutts, taking up 'is beer and turning 'is back on
    him.  "Those of us as live the longest'll see the most."
</p>
<p>
    "I'm glad I've lived long enough to see 'im," ses Bob to Bill Chambers.
    "I feel more satisfied with myself now."
</p>
<p>
    Bill Chambers coughed, and Mr. Cutts, arter finishing 'is beer, took
    another look at Bob Pretty, and went off boiling a'most.
</p>
<p>
    The trouble he took to catch Bob Pretty arter that you wouldn't believe,
    and all the time the game seemed to be simply melting away, and Squire
    Rockett was finding fault with 'im all day long.  He was worn to a
    shadder a'most with watching, and Bob Pretty seemed to be more prosperous
    than ever.
</p>
<p>
    Sometimes Mr. Cutts watched in the plantations, and sometimes 'e hid
    'imself near Bob's house, and at last one night, when 'e was crouching
    behind the fence of Frederick Scott's front garden, 'e saw Bob Pretty
    come out of 'is house and, arter a careful look round, walk up the road.
    He held 'is breath as Bob passed 'im, and was just getting up to foller
    'im when Bob stopped and walked slowly back agin, sniffing.
</p>
<p>
    "Wot a delicious smell o' roses!"  he ses, out loud.
</p>
<p>
    He stood in the middle o' the road nearly opposite where the keeper was
    hiding, and sniffed so that you could ha' 'eard him the other end o' the
    village.
</p>
<p>
    "It can't be roses," he ses, in a puzzled voice, "be-cos there ain't no
    roses hereabouts, and, besides, it's late for 'em.  It must be Mr. Cutts,
    the clever new keeper."
</p>
<p>
    He put his 'ead over the fence and bid 'im good evening, and said wot a
    fine night for a stroll it was, and asked 'im whether 'e was waiting for
    Frederick Scott's aunt.  Mr. Cutts didn't answer 'im a word; 'e was
    pretty near bursting with passion.  He got up and shook 'is fist in Bob
    Pretty's face, and then 'e went off stamping down the road as if 'e was
    going mad.
</p>
<p>
    And for a time Bob Pretty seemed to 'ave all the luck on 'is side.
    Keeper Lewis got rheumatic fever, which 'e put down to sitting about
    night arter night in damp places watching for Bob, and, while 'e was in
    the thick of it, with the doctor going every day, Mr. Cutts fell in
    getting over a fence and broke 'is leg.  Then all the work fell on Keeper
    Smith, and to 'ear 'im talk you'd think that rheumatic fever and broken
    legs was better than anything else in the world.  He asked the squire for
    'elp, but the squire wouldn't give it to 'im, and he kept telling 'im wot
    a feather in 'is cap it would be if 'e did wot the other two couldn't do,
    and caught Bob Pretty.  It was all very well, but, as Smith said, wot 'e
    wanted was feathers in 'is piller, instead of 'aving to snatch a bit o'
    sleep in 'is chair or sitting down with his 'ead agin a tree.  When I
    tell you that 'e fell asleep in this public-'ouse one night while the
    landlord was drawing a pint o' beer he 'ad ordered, you'll know wot 'e
    suffered.
</p>
<p>
    O' course, all this suited Bob Pretty as well as could be, and 'e was
    that good-tempered 'e'd got a nice word for everybody, and when Bill
    Chambers told 'im 'e was foolhardy 'e only laughed and said 'e knew wot
    'e was about.
</p>
<p>
    But the very next night 'e had reason to remember Bill Chambers's words.
    He was walking along Farmer Hall's field&mdash;the one next to the squire's
    plantation&mdash;and, so far from being nervous, 'e was actually a-whistling.
    He'd got a sack over 'is shoulder, loaded as full as it could be, and 'e
    'ad just stopped to light 'is pipe when three men burst out o' the
    plantation and ran toward 'im as 'ard as they could run.
</p>

</center>
<!--IMAGE END-->
<p>
    Bob Pretty just gave one look and then 'e dropped 'is pipe and set off
    like a hare.  It was no good dropping the sack, because Smith, the
    keeper, 'ad recognised 'im and called 'im by name, so 'e just put 'is
    teeth together and did the best he could, and there's no doubt that if it
    'adn't ha' been for the sack 'e could 'ave got clear away.
</p>
<p>
    As it was, 'e ran for pretty near a mile, and they could 'ear 'im
    breathing like a pair o' bellows; but at last 'e saw that the game was
    up.  He just man-aged to struggle as far as Farmer Pinnock's pond, and
    then, waving the sack round his 'ead, 'e flung it into the middle of it,
    and fell down gasping for breath.
</p>
<p>
    "Got&mdash;you&mdash;this time&mdash;Bob Pretty," ses one o' the men, as they came up.
</p>
<p>
    "Wot&mdash;Mr. Cutts?"  ses Bob, with a start.  "That's me, my man," ses the
    keeper.
</p>
<p>
    "Why&mdash;I thought&mdash;you was.  Is that Mr. Lewis?  It can't be."
</p>
<p>
    "That's me," ses Keeper Lewis.  "We both got well sudden-like, Bob
    Pretty, when we 'eard you was out.  You ain't so sharp as you thought you
    was."
</p>
<p>
    Bob Pretty sat still, getting 'is breath back and doing a bit o' thinking
    at the same time.
</p>
<p>
    "You give me a start," he ses, at last.  "I thought you was both in bed,
    and, knowing 'ow hard worked Mr. Smith 'as been, I just came round to
    'elp 'im keep watch like.  I promised to 'elp you, Mr. Cutts, if you
    remember."
</p>
<p>
    "Wot was that you threw in the pond just now?" ses Mr. Cutts.
</p>
<p>
    "A sack," ses Bob Pretty; "a sack I found in Farmer Hall's field.  It
    felt to me as though it might 'ave birds in it, so I picked it up, and I
    was just on my way to your 'ouse with it, Mr. Cutts, when you started
    arter me."
</p>
<p>
    "Ah!" ses the keeper, "and wot did you run for?"
</p>
<p>
    Bob Pretty tried to laugh.  "Becos I thought it was the poachers arter
    me," he ses.  "It seems ridikilous, don't it?"
</p>
<p>
    "Yes, it does," ses Lewis.
</p>
<p>
    "I thought you'd know me a mile off," ses Mr. Cutts.  "I should ha'
    thought the smell o' roses would ha' told you I was near."
</p>
<p>
    Bob Pretty scratched 'is 'ead and looked at 'im out of the corner of 'is
    eye, but he 'adn't got any answer.  Then 'e sat biting his finger-nails
    and thinking while the keepers stood argyfying as to who should take 'is
    clothes off and go into the pond arter the pheasants.  It was a very cold
    night and the pond was pretty deep in places, and none of 'em seemed
    anxious.
</p>
<p>
    "Make 'im go in for it," ses Lewis, looking at Bob; "'e chucked it in."
</p>
<p>
    "On'y Becos I thought you was poachers," ses Bob.  "I'm sorry to 'ave
    caused so much trouble."
</p>
<p>
    "Well, you go in and get it out," ses Lewis, who pretty well guessed
    who'd 'ave to do it if Bob didn't.  "It'll look better for you, too."
</p>
<p>
    "I've got my defence all right," ses Bob Pretty.  "I ain't set a foot on
    the squire's preserves, and I found this sack a 'undred yards away from
    it."
</p>
<p>
    "Don't waste more time," ses Mr. Cutts to Lewis.
</p>
<p>
    "Off with your clothes and in with you.  Anybody'd think you was afraid
    of a little cold water."
</p>
<p>
    "Whereabouts did 'e pitch it in?"  ses Lewis.
</p>
<p>
    Bob Pretty pointed with 'is finger exactly where 'e thought it was, but
    they wouldn't listen to 'im, and then Lewis, arter twice saying wot a bad
    cold he'd got, took 'is coat off very slow and careful.

<p>
    "I wouldn't mind going in to oblige you," ses Bob Pretty, "but the pond
    is so full o' them cold, slimy efts; I don't fancy them crawling up agin
    me, and, besides that, there's such a lot o' deep holes in it.  And
    wotever you do don't put your 'ead under; you know 'ow foul that water
    is."
</p>
<p>
    Keeper Lewis pretended not to listen to 'im.  He took off 'is clothes
    very slowly and then 'e put one foot in and stood shivering, although
    Smith, who felt the water with his 'and, said it was quite warm.  Then
    Lewis put the other foot in and began to walk about careful, 'arf-way up
    to 'is knees.
</p>
<p>
    "I can't find it," he ses, with 'is teeth chattering.
</p>
<p>
    "You 'aven't looked," ses Mr. Cutts; "walk about more; you can't expect
    to find it all at once.  Try the middle."
</p>
<p>
    Lewis tried the middle, and 'e stood there up to 'is neck, feeling about
    with his foot and saying things out loud about Bob Pretty, and other
    things under 'is breath about Mr. Cutts.
</p>
<p>
    "Well, I'm going off 'ome," ses Bob Pretty, getting up.  "I'm too
    tender-'arted to stop and see a man drownded."
</p>
<p>
    "You stay 'ere," ses Mr. Cutts, catching 'old of him.
</p>
<p>
    "Wot for?" ses Bob; "you've got no right to keep me 'ere."
</p>
<p>
    "Catch 'old of 'im, Joe," ses Mr. Cutts, quick-like.
</p>
<p>
    Smith caught 'old of his other arm, and Lewis left off trying to find the
    sack to watch the struggle.  Bob Pretty fought 'ard, and once or twice 'e
    nearly tumbled Mr. Cutts into the pond, but at last 'e gave in and lay
    down panting and talking about 'is loryer.  Smith 'eld him down on the
    ground while Mr. Cutts kept pointing out places with 'is finger for Lewis
    to walk to.  The last place 'e pointed to wanted a much taller man, but
    it wasn't found out till too late, and the fuss Keeper Lewis made when 'e
    could speak agin was terrible.
</p>
<p>
    "You'd better come out," ses Mr. Cutts; "you ain't doing no good.  We
    know where they are and we'll watch the pond till daylight&mdash;that is,
    unless Smith 'ud like to 'ave a try."
</p>
<p>
    "It's pretty near daylight now, I think," ses Smith.
</p>
<p>
    Lewis came out and ran up and down to dry 'imself, and finished off on
    'is pocket-'andkerchief, and then with 'is teeth chattering 'e began to
    dress 'imself.  He got 'is shirt on, and then 'e stood turning over 'is
    clothes as if 'e was looking for something.
</p>
<p>
    "Never mind about your stud now," ses Mr. Cutts; "hurry up and dress."
</p>
<p>
    "Stud?" ses Lewis, very snappish.  "I'm looking for my trowsis."
</p>
<p>
    "Your trowsis?" ses Smith, 'elping 'im look.
</p>
<p>
    "I put all my clothes together," ses Lewis, a'most shouting.  "Where are
    they?  I'm 'arf perished with cold.  Where are they?"
</p>
<p>
    "He 'ad 'em on this evening," ses Bob Pretty, "'cos I remember noticing
    'em."
</p>
<p>
    "They must be somewhere about," ses Mr. Cutts; "why don't you use your
    eyes?"
</p>
<p>
    He walked up and down, peering about, and as for Lewis he was 'opping
    round 'arf crazy.
</p>
<p>
    "I wonder," ses Bob Pretty, in a thoughtful voice, to Smith&mdash;"I wonder
    whether you or Mr. Cutts kicked 'em in the pond while you was struggling
    with me.  Come to think of it, I seem to remember 'earing a splash."
</p>
<p>
    "He's done it, Mr. Cutts," ses Smith; "never mind, it'll go all the
    'arder with 'im."
</p>
<p>
    "But I do mind," ses Lewis, shouting.  "I'll be even with you for this,
    Bob Pretty.  I'll make you feel it.  You wait till I've done with you.
    You'll get a month extra for this, you see if you don't."
</p>
<p>
    "Don't you mind about me," ses Bob; "you run off 'ome and cover up them
    legs of yours.  I found that sack, so my conscience is clear."
</p>
<p>
    Lewis put on 'is coat and waistcoat and set off, and Mr. Cutts and Smith,
    arter feeling about for a dry place, set theirselves down and began to
    smoke.
</p>
<p>
    "Look 'ere," ses Bob Pretty, "I'm not going to sit 'ere all night to
    please you; I'm going off 'ome.  If you want me you'll know where to find
    me."
</p>
<p>
    "You stay where you are," ses Mr. Cutts.  "We ain't going to let you out
    of our sight."
</p>
<p>
    "Very well, then, you take me 'ome," ses Bob.  "I'm not going to catch my
    death o' cold sitting 'ere.  I'm not used to being out of a night like
    you are.  I was brought up respectable."
</p>
<p>
    "I dare say," ses Mr. Cutts.  "Take you 'ome, and then 'ave one o' your
    mates come and get the sack while we're away."
</p>
<p>
    Then Bob Pretty lost 'is temper, and the things 'e said about Mr. Cutts
    wasn't fit for Smith to 'ear.  He threw 'imself down at last full length
    on the ground and sulked till the day broke.
</p>
<p>
    Keeper Lewis was there a'most as soon as it was light, with some long
    hay-rakes he'd borrowed, and I should think that pretty near 'arf the
    folks in Clay-bury 'ad turned up to see the fun.  Mrs. Pretty was crying
    and wringing 'er 'ands; but most folks seemed to be rather pleased that
    Bob 'ad been caught at last.
</p>
<p>
    In next to no time 'arf-a-dozen rakes was at work, and the things they
    brought out o' that pond you wouldn't believe.  The edge of it was all
    littered with rusty tin pails and saucepans and such-like, and by-and-by
    Lewis found the things he'd 'ad to go 'ome without a few hours afore, but
    they didn't seem to find that sack, and Bob Pretty, wot was talking to
    'is wife, began to look 'opeful.
</p>
<p>
    But just then the squire came riding up with two friends as was staying
    with 'im, and he offered a reward of five shillings to the man wot found
    it.  Three or four of 'em waded in up to their middle then and raked
    their 'ardest, and at last Henery Walker give a cheer and brought it to
    the side, all heavy with water.
</p>
<p>
    "That's the sack I found, sir," ses Bob, starting up.  "It wasn't on your
    land at all, but on the field next to it.  I'm an honest, 'ardworking
    man, and I've never been in trouble afore.  Ask anybody 'ere and they'll
    tell you the same."
</p>
<p>
    Squire Rockett took no notice of 'im.  "Is that the sack?"  he asks,
    turning to Mr. Cutts.
</p>
<p>
    "That's the one, sir," ses Mr. Cutts.  "I'd swear to it anywhere."
</p>
<p>
    "You'd swear a man's life away," ses Bob.  "'Ow can you swear to it when
    it was dark?"
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Cutts didn't answer 'im.  He went down on 'is knees and cut the
    string that tied up the mouth o' the sack, and then 'e started back as if
    'e'd been shot, and 'is eyes a'most started out of 'is 'ead.
</p>
<p>
    "Wot's the matter?" ses the squire.
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Cutts couldn't speak; he could only stutter and point at the sack
    with 'is finger, and Henery Walker, as was getting curious, lifted up the
    other end of it and out rolled a score of as fine cabbages as you could
    wish to see.
</p>
<p>
    I never see people so astonished afore in all my born days, and as for
    Bob Pretty, 'e stood staring at them cabbages as if 'e couldn't believe
    'is eyesight.
</p>
<p>
    "And that's wot I've been kept 'ere all night for," he ses, at last,
    shaking his 'ead.  "That's wot comes o' trying to do a kindness to
    keepers, and 'elping of 'em in their difficult work.  P'r'aps that ain't
    the sack arter all, Mr. Cutts.  I could ha' sworn they was pheasants in
    the one I found, but I may be mistook, never 'aving 'ad one in my 'ands
    afore.  Or p'r'aps somebody was trying to 'ave a game with you, Mr.
    Cutts, and deceived me instead."
</p>
<p>
    The keepers on'y stared at 'im.
</p>
<p>
    "You ought to be more careful," ses Bob.  "Very likely while you was
    taking all that trouble over me, and Keeper Lewis was catching 'is death
    o' cold, the poachers was up at the plantation taking all they wanted.
    And, besides, it ain't right for Squire Rockett to 'ave to pay Henery
    Walker five shillings for finding a lot of old cabbages.  I shouldn't
    like it myself."

<p>
    He looked out of the corner of 'is eye at the squire, as was pretending
    not to notice Henery Walker touching 'is cap to him, and then 'e turns to
    'is wife and he ses:
</p>
<p>
    "Come along, old gal," 'e ses.  "I want my breakfast bad, and arter that
    I shall 'ave to lose a honest day's work in bed."

    DIXON'S RETURN
</h2>
<p>
    Talking about eddication, said the night-watchman, thoughtfully, the
    finest eddication you can give a lad is to send 'im to sea.  School is
    all right up to a certain p'int, but arter that comes the sea.  I've been
    there myself and I know wot I'm talking about.  All that I am I owe to
    'aving been to sea.

<p>
    There's a saying that boys will be boys.  That's all right till they go
    to sea, and then they 'ave to be men, and good men too.  They get knocked
    about a bit, o' course, but that's all part o' the eddication, and when
    they get bigger they pass the eddication they've received on to other
    boys smaller than wot they are.  Arter I'd been at sea a year I spent all
    my fust time ashore going round and looking for boys wot 'ad knocked me
    about afore I sailed, and there was only one out o' the whole lot that I
    wished I 'adn't found.
</p>
<p>
    Most people, o' course, go to sea as boys or else not at all, but I mind
    one chap as was pretty near thirty years old when 'e started.  It's a
    good many years ago now, and he was landlord of a public-'ouse as used to
    stand in Wapping, called the Blue Lion.
</p>
<p>
    His mother, wot had 'ad the pub afore 'im, 'ad brought 'im up very quiet
    and genteel, and when she died 'e went and married a fine, handsome young
    woman who 'ad got her eye on the pub without thinking much about 'im.  I
    got to know about it through knowing the servant that lived there.  A
    nice, quiet gal she was, and there wasn't much went on that she didn't
    hear.  I've known 'er to cry for hours with the ear-ache, pore gal.
</p>
<p>
    Not caring much for 'er 'usband, and being spoiled by 'im into the
    bargain, Mrs. Dixon soon began to lead 'im a terrible life.  She was
    always throwing his meekness and mildness up into 'is face, and arter
    they 'ad been married two or three years he was no more like the landlord
    o' that public-'ouse than I'm like a lord.  Not so much.  She used to get
    into such terrible tempers there was no doing anything with 'er, and for
    the sake o' peace and quietness he gave way to 'er till 'e got into the
    habit of it and couldn't break 'imself of it.
</p>
<p>
    They 'adn't been married long afore she 'ad her cousin, Charlie Burge,
    come in as barman, and a month or two arter that 'is brother Bob, who 'ad
    been spending a lot o' time looking for work instead o' doing it, came
    too.  They was so comfortable there that their father&mdash;a 'ouse-painter by
    trade&mdash;came round to see whether he couldn't paint the Blue Lion up a bit
    and make 'em look smart, so that they'd get more trade.  He was one o'
    these 'ere fust-class 'ousepainters that can go to sleep on a ladder
    holding a brush in one hand and a pot o' paint in the other, and by the
    time he 'ad finished painting the 'ouse it was ready to be done all over
    agin.
</p>
<p>
    I dare say that George Dixon&mdash;that was 'is name&mdash;wouldn't ha' minded so
    much if 'is wife 'ad only been civil, but instead o' that she used to
    make fun of 'im and order 'im about, and by-and-by the others began to
    try the same thing.  As I said afore, Dixon was a very quiet man, and if
    there was ever anybody to be put outside Charlie or Bob used to do it.
    They tried to put me outside once, the two of 'em, but they on'y did it
    at last by telling me that somebody 'ad gone off and left a pot o' beer
    standing on the pavement.  They was both of 'em fairly strong young chaps
    with a lot of bounce in 'em, and she used to say to her 'usband wot fine
    young fellers they was, and wot a pity it was he wasn't like 'em.
</p>
<p>
    Talk like this used to upset George Dixon awful.  Having been brought up
    careful by 'is mother, and keeping a very quiet, respectable 'ouse&mdash;I
    used it myself&mdash;he cert'nly was soft, and I remember 'im telling me once
    that he didn't believe in fighting, and that instead of hitting people
    you ought to try and persuade them.  He was uncommon fond of 'is wife,
    but at last one day, arter she 'ad made a laughing-stock of 'im in the
    bar, he up and spoke sharp to her.
</p>
<p>
    "Wot?" ses Mrs. Dixon, 'ardly able to believe her ears.
</p>
<p>
    "Remember who you're speaking to; that's wot I said," ses Dixon.
</p>
<p>
    "'Ow dare you talk to me like that?"  screams 'is wife, turning red with
    rage.  "Wot d'ye mean by it?"
</p>
<p>
    "Because you seem to forget who is master 'ere," ses Dixon, in a
    trembling voice.
</p>
<p>
    "Master?" she ses, firing up.  "I'll soon show you who's master.  Go out
    o' my bar; I won't 'ave you in it.  D'ye 'ear?  Go out of it."
</p>
<p>
    Dixon turned away and began to serve a customer.  "D'ye hear wot I say?"
    ses Mrs. Dixon, stamping 'er foot.  "Go out o' my bar.  Here, Charlie!"
</p>
<p>
    "Hullo!" ses 'er cousin, who 'ad been standing looking on and grinning.
</p>
<p>
    "Take the master and put 'im into the parlour," ses Mrs. Dixon, "and
    don't let 'im come out till he's begged my pardon."
</p>
<p>
    "Go on," ses Charlie, brushing up 'is shirt-sleeves; "in you go.  You
    'ear wot she said."
</p>
<p>
    He caught 'old of George Dixon, who 'ad just turned to the back o' the
    bar to give a customer change out of 'arf a crown, and ran 'im kicking
    and struggling into the parlour.  George gave 'im a silly little punch in
    the chest, and got such a bang on the 'ead back that at fust he thought
    it was knocked off.
</p>
<p>
    When 'e came to 'is senses agin the door leading to the bar was shut, and
    'is wife's uncle, who 'ad been asleep in the easy-chair, was finding
    fault with 'im for waking 'im up.
</p>
<p>
    "Why can't you be quiet and peaceable?"  he ses, shaking his 'ead at him.
    "I've been 'ard at work all the morning thinking wot colour to paint the
    back-door, and this is the second time I've been woke up since dinner.
    You're old enough to know better."
</p>
<p>
    "Go and sleep somewhere else, then," ses Dixon.  "I don't want you 'ere
    at all, or your boys neither.  Go and give somebody else a treat; I've
    'ad enough of the whole pack of you."
</p>

alt="''go and Sleep Somewhere Else, Then,' Ses Dixon.'

</center>
<!--IMAGE END-->
<p>
    He sat down and put 'is feet in the fender, and old Burge, as soon as he
    'ad got 'is senses back, went into the bar and complained to 'is niece,
    and she came into the parlour like a thunderstorm.
</p>
<p>
    "You'll beg my uncle's pardon as well as mine afore you come out o' that
    room," she said to her 'usband; "mind that."
</p>
<p>
    George Dixon didn't say a word; the shame of it was a'most more than 'e
    could stand.  Then 'e got up to go out o' the parlour and Charlie pushed
    'im back agin.  Three times he tried, and then 'e stood up and looked at
    'is wife.
</p>
<p>
    "I've been a good 'usband to you," he ses; "but there's no satisfying
    you.  You ought to ha' married somebody that would ha' knocked you about,
    and then you'd ha' been happy.  I'm too fond of a quiet life to suit
    you."
</p>
<p>
    "Are you going to beg my pardon and my uncle's pardon?" ses 'is wife,
    stamping 'er foot.
</p>
<p>
    "No," ses Dixon; "I am not.  I'm surprised at you asking it."
</p>
<p>
    "Well, you don't come out o' this room till you do," ses 'is wife.
</p>
<p>
    "That won't hurt me," ses Dixon.  "I couldn't look anybody in the face
    arter being pushed out o' my own bar."
</p>
<p>
    They kept 'im there all the rest o' the day, and, as 'e was still
    obstinate when bedtime came, Mrs. Dixon, who wasn't to be beat, brought
    down some bedclothes and 'ad a bed made up for 'im on the sofa.  Some men
    would ha' 'ad the police in for less than that, but George Dixon 'ad got
    a great deal o' pride and 'e couldn't bear the shame of it.  Instead o'
    that 'e acted like a fourteen-year-old boy and ran away to sea.
</p>
<p>
    They found 'im gone when they came down in the morning, and the side-door
    on the latch.  He 'ad left a letter for 'is wife on the table, telling
    'er wot he 'ad done.  Short and sweet it was, and wound up with telling
    'er to be careful that her uncle and cousins didn't eat 'er out of house
    and 'ome.
</p>
<p>
    She got another letter two days arterward, saying that he 'ad shipped as
    ordinary seaman on an American barque called the <i>Seabird,</i> bound for
    California, and that 'e expected to be away a year, or thereabouts.
</p>
<p>
    "It'll do 'im good," ses old Burge, when Mrs. Dixon read the letter to
    'em.  "It's a 'ard life is the sea, and he'll appreciate his 'ome when 'e
    comes back to it agin.  He don't know when 'e's well off.  It's as
    comfortable a 'ome as a man could wish to 'ave."  It was surprising wot a
    little difference George Dixon's being away made to the Blue Lion.
    Nobody seemed to miss 'im much, and things went on just the same as afore
    he went.  Mrs. Dixon was all right with most people, and 'er relations
    'ad a very good time of it; old Burge began to put on flesh at such a
    rate that the sight of a ladder made 'im ill a'most, and Charlie and Bob
    went about as if the place belonged to 'em.
</p>
<p>
    They 'eard nothing for eight months, and then a letter came for Mrs.
    Dixon from her 'usband in which he said that 'e had left the <i>Seabird</i>
    after 'aving had a time which made 'im shiver to think of.  He said that
    the men was the roughest of the rough and the officers was worse, and
    that he 'ad hardly 'ad a day without a blow from one or the other since
    he'd been aboard.  He'd been knocked down with a hand-spike by the second
    mate, and had 'ad a week in his bunk with a kick given 'im by the
    boatswain.  He said 'e was now on the <i>Rochester Castle,</i> bound for
    Sydney, and he 'oped for better times.
</p>
<p>
    That was all they 'eard for some months, and then they got another letter
    saying that the men on the <i>Rochester Castle</i> was, if anything, worse
    than those on the Seabird, and that he'd begun to think that running away
    to sea was diff'rent to wot he'd expected, and that he supposed 'e'd done
    it too late in life.  He sent 'is love to 'is wife and asked 'er as a
    favour to send Uncle Burge and 'is boys away, as 'e didn't want to find
    them there when 'e came home, because they was the cause of all his
    sufferings.
</p>
<p>
    "He don't know 'is best friends," ses old Burge.  "'E's got a nasty
    sperrit I don't like to see."
</p>
<p>
    "I'll 'ave a word with 'im when 'e does come home," ses Bob.  "I s'pose
    he thinks 'imself safe writing letters thousands o' miles away."
</p>
<p>
    The last letter they 'ad came from Auckland, and said that he 'ad shipped
    on the <i>Monarch,</i> bound for the Albert Docks, and he 'oped soon to be at
    'ome and managing the Blue Lion, same as in the old happy days afore he
    was fool enough to go to sea.
</p>
<p>
    That was the very last letter, and some time arterward the <i>Monarch</i> was
    in the missing list, and by-and-by it became known that she 'ad gone down
    with all hands not long arter leaving New Zealand.  The only difference
    it made at the Blue Lion was that Mrs. Dixon 'ad two of 'er dresses dyed
    black, and the others wore black neckties for a fortnight and spoke of
    Dixon as pore George, and said it was a funny world, but they supposed
    everything was for the best.
</p>
<p>
    It must ha' been pretty near four years since George Dixon 'ad run off to
    sea when Charlie, who was sitting in the bar one arternoon reading the
    paper, things being dull, saw a man's head peep through the door for a
    minute and then disappear.  A'most direckly arterward it looked in at
    another door and then disappeared agin.  When it looked in at the third
    door Charlie 'ad put down 'is paper and was ready for it.
</p>
<p>
    "Who are you looking for?" he ses, rather sharp.  "Wot d'ye want?  Are
    you 'aving a game of peepbo, or wot?"
</p>
<p>
    The man coughed and smiled, and then 'e pushed the door open gently and
    came in, and stood there fingering 'is beard as though 'e didn't know wot
    to say.
</p>
<p>
    "I've come back, Charlie," he ses at last.
</p>
<p>
    "Wot, George!"  ses Charlie, starting.  "Why, I didn't know you in that
    beard.  We all thought you was dead, years ago."
</p>
<p>
    "I was pretty nearly, Charlie," ses Dixon, shaking his 'ead.  "Ah! I've
    'ad a terrible time since I left 'once."
</p>
<p>
    "'You don't seem to ha' made your fortune," ses Charlie, looking down at
    'is clothes.  "I'd ha' been ashamed to come 'ome like that if it 'ad been
    me."
</p>
<p>
    "I'm wore out," ses Dixon, leaning agin the bar.  "I've got no pride
    left; it's all been knocked out of me.  How's Julia?"
</p>
<p>
    "She's all right," ses Charlie.  "Here, Ju&mdash;"
</p>
<p>
    "H'sh!" ses Dixon, reaching over the bar and laying his 'and on his arm.
    "Don't let 'er know too sudden; break it to 'er gently."
</p>
<p>
    "Fiddlesticks!"  ses Charlie, throwing his 'and off and calling, "Here,
    Julia!  He's come back."
</p>
<p>
    Mrs. Dixon came running downstairs and into the bar.  "Good gracious!"
    she ses, staring at her 'us-band.  "Whoever'd ha' thought o' seeing you
    agin?  Where 'ave you sprung from?"
</p>
<p>
    "Ain't you glad to see me, Julia?"  ses George Dixon.
</p>
<p>
    "Yes, I s'pose so; if you've come back to behave yourself," ses Mrs.
    Dixon.  "What 'ave you got to say for yourself for running away and then
    writing them letters, telling me to get rid of my relations?"
</p>
<p>
    "That's a long time ago, Julia," ses Dixon, raising the flap in the
    counter and going into the bar.  "I've gone through a great deal o'
    suffering since then.  I've been knocked about till I 'adn't got any
    feeling left in me; I've been shipwrecked, and I've 'ad to fight for my
    life with savages."
</p>
<p>
    "Nobody asked you to run away," ses his wife, edging away as he went to
    put his arm round 'er waist.  "You'd better go upstairs and put on some
    decent clothes."
</p>

<p>
    Dixon looked at 'er for a moment and then he 'ung his 'ead.
</p>
<p>
    "I've been thinking o' you and of seeing you agin every day since I went
    away, Julia," he ses.  "You'd be the same to me if you was dressed in
    rags."
</p>
<p>
    He went upstairs without another word, and old Burge, who was coming
    down, came down five of 'em at once owing to Dixon speaking to 'im afore
    he knew who 'e was.  The old man was still grumbling when Dixon came down
    agin, and said he believed he'd done it a-purpose.
</p>
<p>
    "You run away from a good 'ome," he ses, "and the best wife in Wapping,
    and you come back and frighten people 'arf out o' their lives.  I never
    see such a feller in all my born days."
</p>
<p>
    "I was so glad to get 'ome agin I didn't think," ses Dixon.  "I hope
    you're not 'urt."
</p>
<p>
    He started telling them all about his 'ardships while they were at tea,
    but none of 'em seemed to care much about hearing 'em.  Bob said that the
    sea was all right for men, and that other people were sure not to like
    it.
</p>
<p>
    "And you brought it all on yourself," ses Charlie.  "You've only got
    yourself to thank for it.  I 'ad thought o' picking a bone with you over
    those letters you wrote."
</p>
<p>
    "Let's 'ope 'e's come back more sensible than wot 'e was when 'e went
    away," ses old Burge, with 'is mouth full o' toast.
</p>
<p>
    By the time he'd been back a couple o' days George Dixon could see that
    'is going away 'adn't done any good at all.  Nobody seemed to take any
    notice of 'im or wot he said, and at last, arter a word or two with
    Charlie about the rough way he spoke to some o' the customers, Charlie
    came in to Mrs. Dixon and said that he was at 'is old tricks of
    interfering, and he would not 'ave it.
</p>
<p>
    "Well, he'd better keep out o' the bar altogether," ses Mrs. Dixon.
    "There's no need for 'im to go there; we managed all right while 'e was
    away."
</p>
<p>
    "Do you mean I'm not to go into my own bar?" ses Dixon, stammering.
</p>
<p>
    "Yes, I do," ses Mrs. Dixon.  "You kept out of it for four years to
    please yourself, and now you can keep out of it to please me."
</p>
<p>
    "I've put you out o' the bar before," ses Charlie, "and if you come
    messing about with me any more I'll do it agin.  So now you know."
</p>
<p>
    He walked back into the bar whistling, and George Dixon, arter sitting
    still for a long time thinking, got up and went into the bar, and he'd
    'ardly got his foot inside afore Charlie caught 'old of 'im by the
    shoulder and shoved 'im back into the parlour agin.
</p>
<p>
    "I told you wot it would be," ses Mrs. Dixon, looking up from 'er sewing.
    "You've only got your interfering ways to thank for it."
</p>
<p>
    "This is a fine state of affairs in my own 'ouse," ses Dixon, 'ardly able
    to speak.  "You've got no proper feeling for your husband, Julia, else
    you wouldn't allow it.  Why, I was happier at sea than wot I am 'ere."
</p>
<p>
    "Well, you'd better go back to it if you're so fond of it," ses 'is wife.
</p>
<p>
    "I think I 'ad," ses Dixon.  "If I can't be master in my own 'ouse I'm
    better at sea, hard as it is.  You must choose between us, Julia&mdash;me or
    your relations.  I won't sleep under the same roof as them for another
    night.  Am I to go?"
</p>
<p>
    "Please yourself," ses 'is wife.  "I don't mind your staying 'ere so long
    as you behave yourself, but the others won't go; you can make your mind
    easy on that."
</p>
<p>
    "I'll go and look for another ship, then," ses Dixon, taking up 'is cap.
    "I'm not wanted here.  P'r'aps you wouldn't mind 'aving some clothes
    packed into a chest for me so as I can go away decent."
</p>
<p>
    He looked round at 'is wife, as though 'e expected she'd ask 'im not to
    go, but she took no notice, and he opened the door softly and went out,
    while old Burge, who 'ad come into the room and 'eard what he was saying,
    trotted off upstairs to pack 'is chest for 'im.
</p>
<p>
    In two hours 'e was back agin and more cheerful than he 'ad been since he
    'ad come 'ome.  Bob was in the bar and the others were just sitting down
    to tea, and a big chest, nicely corded, stood on the floor in the corner
    of the room.
</p>
<p>
    "That's right," he ses, looking at it; "that's just wot I wanted."
</p>
<p>
    "It's as full as it can be," ses old Burge.  "I done it for you myself.
    'Ave you got a ship?"
</p>
<p>
    "I 'ave," ses Dixon.  "A jolly good ship.  No more hardships for me this
    time.  I've got a berth as captain."
</p>
<p>
    "Wot?" ses 'is wife.  "Captain?  You!"
</p>
<p>
    "Yes," ses Dixon, smiling at her.  "You can sail with me if you like."
</p>
<p>
    "Thankee," ses Mrs. Dixon, "I'm quite comfortable where I am."
</p>
<p>
    "Do you mean to say you've got a master's berth?" ses Charlie, staring at
    'im.
</p>
<p>
    "I do," ses Dixon; "master and owner."
</p>
<p>
    Charlie coughed.  "Wot's the name of the ship?"  he asks, winking at the
    others.
</p>
<p>
    "The BLUE LION," ses Dixon, in a voice that made 'em all start.  "I'm
    shipping a new crew and I pay off the old one to-night.  You first, my
    lad."
</p>
<p>
    "Pay off," ses Charlie, leaning back in 'is chair and staring at 'im in a
    puzzled way.  "Blue Lion?"
</p>
<p>
    "Yes," ses Dixon, in the same loud voice.  "When I came 'ome the other
    day I thought p'r'aps I'd let bygones be bygones, and I laid low for a
    bit to see whether any of you deserved it.  I went to sea to get
    hardened&mdash;and I got hard.  I've fought men that would eat you at a meal.
    I've 'ad more blows in a week than you've 'ad in a lifetime, you
    fat-faced land-lubber."
</p>
<p>
    He walked to the door leading to the bar, where Bob was doing 'is best to
    serve customers and listen at the same time, and arter locking it put the
    key in 'is pocket.  Then 'e put his 'and in 'is pocket and slapped some
    money down on the table in front o' Charlie.
</p>
<p>
    "There's a month's pay instead o' notice," he ses.  "Now git."
</p>
<p>
    "George!" screams 'is wife.  "'Ow dare you?  'Ave you gone crazy?"
</p>
<p>
    "I'm surprised at you," ses old Burge, who'd been looking on with 'is
    mouth wide open, and pinching 'imself to see whether 'e wasn't dreaming.
</p>
<p>
    "I don't go for your orders," ses Charlie, getting up.  "Wot d'ye mean by
    locking that door?"
</p>
<p>
    "Wot!" roars Dixon.  "Hang it!  I mustn't lock a door without asking my
    barman now.  Pack up and be off, you swab, afore I start on you."
</p>
<p>
    Charlie gave a growl and rushed at 'im, and the next moment 'e was down
    on the floor with the 'ardest bang in the face that he'd ever 'ad in 'is
    life.  Mrs. Dixon screamed and ran into the kitchen, follered by old
    Burge, who went in to tell 'er not to be frightened.  Charlie got up and
    went for Dixon agin; but he 'ad come back as 'ard as nails and 'ad a
    rushing style o' fighting that took Charlie's breath away.  By the time
    Bob 'ad left the bar to take care of itself, and run round and got in the
    back way, Charlie had 'ad as much as 'e wanted and was lying on the
    sea-chest in the corner trying to get 'is breath.

<!--IMAGE END-->
<p>
    "Yes?  Wot d'ye want?"  ses Dixon, with a growl, as Bob came in at the
    door.
</p>
<p>
    He was such a 'orrible figure, with the blood on 'is face and 'is beard
    sticking out all ways, that Bob, instead of doing wot he 'ad come round
    for, stood in the doorway staring at 'im without a word.
</p>
<p>
    "I'm paying off," ses Dixon.  "'Ave you got any-thing to say agin it?"
</p>
<p>
    "No," ses Bob, drawing back.
</p>
<p>
    "You and Charlie'll go now," ses Dixon, taking out some money.  "The old
    man can stay on for a month to give 'im time to look round.  Don't look
    at me that way, else I'll knock your 'ead off."
</p>
<p>
    He started counting out Bob's money just as old Burge and Mrs. Dixon,
    hearing all quiet, came in out of the kitchen.
</p>
<p>
    "Don't you be alarmed on my account, my dear," he ses, turning to 'is
    wife; "it's child's play to wot I've been used to.  I'll just see these
    two mistaken young fellers off the premises, and then we'll 'ave a cup o'
    tea while the old man minds the bar."
</p>
<p>
    Mrs. Dixon tried to speak, but 'er temper was too much for 'er.  She
    looked from her 'usband to Charlie and Bob and then back at 'im agin and
    caught 'er breath.
</p>
<p>
    "That's right," ses Dixon, nodding his 'ead at her.  "I'm master and
    owner of the Blue Lion and you're first mate.  When I'm speaking you keep
    quiet; that's dissipline."
</p>
<p>
    I was in that bar about three months arterward, and I never saw such
    a change in any woman as there was in Mrs. Dixon.  Of all the
    nice-mannered, soft-spoken landladies I've ever seen, she was the best,
    and on'y to 'ear the way she answered her 'usband when he spoke to 'er
    was a pleasure to every married man in the bar.

<h2>
    A SPIRIT OF AVARICE
</h2>
<p>
    Mr. John Blows stood listening to the foreman with an air of lofty
    disdain.  He was a free-born Englishman, and yet he had been summarily
    paid off at eleven o'clock in the morning and told that his valuable
    services would no longer be required.  More than that, the foreman had
    passed certain strictures upon his features which, however true they
    might be, were quite irrelevant to the fact that Mr. Blows had been
    discovered slumbering in a shed when he should have been laying bricks.
</p>

</center>
<!--IMAGE END-->
<p>
    "Take your ugly face off these 'ere works," said the foreman; "take it
    'ome and bury it in the back-yard.  Anybody'll be glad to lend you a
    spade."
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Blows, in a somewhat fluent reply, reflected severely on the
    foreman's immediate ancestors, and the strange lack of good-feeling and
    public spirit they had exhibited by allowing him to grow up.
</p>
<p>
    "Take it 'ome and bury it," said the foreman again.  "Not under any
    plants you've got a liking for."
</p>
<p>
    "I suppose," said Mr. Blows, still referring to his foe's parents, and
    now endeavouring to make excuses for them&mdash;"I s'pose they was so pleased,
    and so surprised when they found that you was a 'uman being, that they
    didn't mind anything else."
</p>
<p>
    He walked off with his head in the air, and the other men, who had
    partially suspended work to listen, resumed their labours.  A modest pint
    at the Rising Sun revived his drooping spirits, and he walked home
    thinking of several things which he might have said to the foreman if he
    had only thought of them in time.
</p>
<p>
    He paused at the open door of his house and, looking in, sniffed at the
    smell of mottled soap and dirty water which pervaded it.  The stairs were
    wet, and a pail stood in the narrow passage.  From the kitchen came the
    sounds of crying children and a scolding mother.  Master Joseph Henry
    Blows, aged three, was "holding his breath," and the family were all
    aghast at the length of his performance.  He re-covered it as his father
    entered the room, and drowned, without distressing himself, the impotent
    efforts of the others.  Mrs. Blows turned upon her husband a look of hot
    inquiry.
</p>
<p>
    "I've got the chuck," he said, surlily.
</p>
<p>
    "What, again?" said the unfortunate woman.  "Yes, again," repeated her
    husband.
</p>
<p>
    Mrs. Blows turned away, and dropping into a chair threw her apron over
    her head and burst into discordant weeping.  Two little Blows, who had
    ceased their outcries, resumed them again from sheer sympathy.
</p>
<p>
    "Stop it," yelled the indignant Mr. Blows; "stop it at once; d'ye hear?"
</p>
<p>
    "I wish I'd never seen you," sobbed his wife from behind her apron.  "Of
    all the lazy, idle, drunken, good-for-nothing&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>
<p>
    "Go on," said Mr. Blows, grimly.
</p>
<p>
    "You're more trouble than you're worth," declared Mrs. Blows.  "Look at
    your father, my dears," she continued, taking the apron away from her
    face; "take a good look at him, and mind you don't grow up like it."
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Blows met the combined gaze of his innocent offspring with a dark
    scowl, and then fell to moodily walking up and down the passage until he
    fell over the pail.  At that his mood changed, and, turning fiercely, he
    kicked that useful article up and down the passage until he was tired.
</p>
<p>
    "I've 'ad enough of it," he muttered.  He stopped at the kitchen-door
    and, putting his hand in his pocket, threw a handful of change on to the
    floor and swung out of the house.
</p>
<p>
    Another pint of beer confirmed him in his resolution.  He would go far
    away and make a fresh start in the world.  The morning was bright and the
    air fresh, and a pleasant sense of freedom and adventure possessed his
    soul as he walked.  At a swinging pace he soon left Gravelton behind him,
    and, coming to the river, sat down to smoke a final pipe before turning
    his back forever on a town which had treated him so badly.
</p>
<p>
    The river murmured agreeably and the rushes stirred softly in the breeze;
    Mr. Blows, who could fall asleep on an upturned pail, succumbed to the
    influence at once; the pipe dropped from his mouth and he snored
    peacefully.
</p>
<p>
    He was awakened by a choking scream, and, starting up hastily, looked
    about for the cause.  Then in the water he saw the little white face of
    Billy Clements, and wading in up to his middle he reached out and,
    catching the child by the hair, drew him to the bank and set him on his
    feet.  Still screaming with terror, Billy threw up some of the water he
    had swallowed, and without turning his head made off in the direction of
    home, calling piteously upon his mother.
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Blows, shivering on the bank, watched him out of sight, and, missing
    his cap, was just in time to see that friend of several seasons slowly
    sinking in the middle of the river.  He squeezed the water from his
    trousers and, crossing the bridge, set off across the meadows.
</p>
<p>
    His self-imposed term of bachelorhood lasted just three months, at the
    end of which time he made up his mind to enact the part of the generous
    husband and forgive his wife everything.  He would not go into details,
    but issue one big, magnanimous pardon.
</p>
<p>
    Full of these lofty ideas he set off in the direction of home again.  It
    was a three-days' tramp, and the evening of the third day saw him but a
    bare two miles from home.  He clambered up the bank at the side of the
    road and, sprawling at his ease, smoked quietly in the moonlight.
</p>
<p>
    A waggon piled up with straw came jolting and creaking toward him.  The
    driver sat dozing on the shafts, and Mr. Blows smiled pleasantly as he
    recognised the first face of a friend he had seen for three months.  He
    thrust his pipe in his pocket and, rising to his feet, clambered on to
    the back of the waggon, and lying face downward on the straw peered down
    at the unconscious driver below.
</p>
<p>
    "I'll give old Joe a surprise," he said to himself.  "He'll be the first
    to welcome me back."
</p>
<p>
    "Joe," he said, softly.  "'Ow goes it, old pal?"
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Joe Carter, still dozing, opened his eyes at the sound of his name
    and looked round; then, coming to the conclusion that he had been
    dreaming, closed them again.
</p>
<p>
    "I'm a-looking at you, Joe," said Mr. Blows, waggishly.  "I can see you."
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Carter looked up sharply and, catching sight of the grinning features
    of Mr. Blows protruding over the edge of the straw, threw up his arms
    with a piercing shriek and fell off the shafts on to the road.  The
    astounded Mr. Blows, raising himself on his hands, saw him pick himself
    up and, giving vent to a series of fearsome yelps, run clumsily back
    along the road.
</p>
<p>
    "Joe!" shouted Mr. Blows.  "J-o-o-oE!"
</p>

<!--IMAGE END-->
<p>
    Mr. Carter put his hands to his ears and ran on blindly, while his
    friend, sitting on the top of the straw, regarded his proceedings with
    mixed feelings of surprise and indignation.
</p>
<p>
    "It can't be that tanner 'e owes me," he mused, "and yet I don't know
    what else it can be.  I never see a man so jumpy."
</p>
<p>
    He continued to speculate while the old horse, undisturbed by the
    driver's absence, placidly continued its journey.  A mile farther,
    however, he got down to take the short cut by the fields.
</p>
<p>
    "If Joe can't look after his 'orse and cart," he said, primly, as he
    watched it along the road, "it's not my business."
</p>
<p>
    The footpath was not much used at that time of night, and he only met one
    man.  They were in the shadow of the trees which fringed the new cemetery
    as they passed, and both peered.  The stranger was satisfied first and,
    to Mr. Blows's growing indignation, first gave a leap backward which
    would not have disgraced an acrobat, and then made off across the field
    with hideous outcries.
</p>
<p>
    "If I get 'old of some of you," said the offended Mr. Blows, "I'll give
    you something to holler for."
</p>
<p>
    He pursued his way grumbling, and insensibly slackened his pace as he
    drew near home.  A remnant of conscience which had stuck to him without
    encouragement for thirty-five years persisted in suggesting that he had
    behaved badly.  It also made a few ill-bred inquiries as to how his wife
    and children had subsisted for the last three months.  He stood outside
    the house for a short space, and then, opening the door softly, walked
    in.
</p>
<p>
    The kitchen-door stood open, and his wife in a black dress sat sewing by
    the light of a smoky lamp.  She looked up as she heard his footsteps, and
    then, without a word, slid from the chair full length to the floor.
</p>
<p>
    "Go on," said Mr. Blows, bitterly; "keep it up.  Don't mind me."
</p>
<p>
    Mrs. Blows paid no heed; her face was white and her eyes were closed.
    Her husband, with a dawning perception of the state of affairs, drew a
    mug of water from the tap and flung it over her.  She opened her eyes and
    gave a faint scream, and then, scrambling to her feet, tottered toward
    him and sobbed on his breast.
</p>
<p>
    "There, there," said Mr. Blows.  "Don't take on; I forgive you."
</p>
<p>
    "Oh, John," said his wife, sobbing convulsively, "I thought you was dead.
    I thought you was dead.  It's only a fortnight ago since we buried you!"
</p>
<p>
    "Buried me?"  said the startled Mr. Blows.  "Buried me?"
</p>
<p>
    "I shall wake up and find I'm dreaming," wailed Mrs. Blows; "I know I
    shall.  I'm always dreaming that you're not dead.  Night before last I
    dreamt that you was alive, and I woke up sobbing as if my 'art would
    break."
</p>
<p>
    "Sobbing?" said Mr. Blows, with a scowl.  "For joy, John," explained his
    wife.
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Blows was about to ask for a further explanation of the mystery when
    he stopped, and regarded with much interest a fair-sized cask which stood
    in one corner.
</p>
<p>
    "A cask o' beer," he said, staring, as he took a glass from the dresser
    and crossed over to it.  "You don't seem to 'ave taken much 'arm during
    my&mdash;my going after work."
</p>
<p>
    "We 'ad it for the funeral, John," said his wife; "leastways, we 'ad two;
    this is the second."
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Blows, who had filled the glass, set it down on the table untasted;
    things seemed a trifle uncanny.
</p>
<p>
    "Go on," said Mrs. Blows; "you've got more right to it than anybody else.
    Fancy 'aving you here drinking up the beer for your own funeral."
</p>
<p>
    "I don't understand what you're a-driving at," retorted Mr. Blows,
    drinking somewhat gingerly from the glass.  "'Ow could there be a funeral
    without me?"
</p>
<p>
    "It's all a mistake," said the overjoyed Mrs. Blows; "we must have buried
    somebody else.  But such a funeral, John; you would ha' been proud if you
    could ha' seen it.  All Gravelton followed, nearly.  There was the boys'
    drum and fife band, and the Ancient Order of Camels, what you used to
    belong to, turned out with their brass band and banners&mdash;all the people
    marching four abreast and sometimes five."
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Blows's face softened; he had no idea that he had established himself
    so firmly in the affections of his fellow-townsmen.
</p>
<p>
    "Four mourning carriages," continued his wife, "and the&mdash;the hearse, all
    covered in flowers so that you couldn't see it 'ardly.  One wreath cost
    two pounds."
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Blows endeavoured to conceal his gratification beneath a mask of
    surliness.  "Waste o' money," he growled, and stooping to the cask drew
    himself an-other glass of beer.
</p>
<p>
    "Some o' the gentry sent their carriages to follow," said Mrs. Blows,
    sitting down and clasping her hands in her lap.
</p>
<p>
    "I know one or two that 'ad a liking for me," said Mr. Blows, almost
    blushing.
</p>
<p>
    "And to think that it's all a mistake," continued his wife.  "But I
    thought it was you; it was dressed like you, and your cap was found near
    it."
</p>
<p>
    "H'm," said Mr. Blows; "a pretty mess you've been and made of it.  Here's
    people been giving two pounds for wreaths and turning up with brass bands
    and banners because they thought it was me, and it's all been wasted."
</p>
<p>
    "It wasn't my fault," said his wife.  "Little Billy Clements came running
    'ome the day you went away and said 'e'd fallen in the water, and you'd
    gone in and pulled 'im out.  He said 'e thought you was drownded, and
    when you didn't come 'ome I naturally thought so too.  What else could I
    think?"
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Blows coughed, and holding his glass up to the light regarded it with
    a preoccupied air.
</p>
<p>
    "They dragged the river," resumed his wife, "and found the cap, but they
    didn't find the body till nine weeks afterward.  There was a inquest at
    the Peal o' Bells, and I identified you, and all that grand funeral was
    because they thought you'd lost your life saving little Billy.  They said
    you was a hero."

<p>
    "You've made a nice mess of it," repeated Mr. Blows.
</p>
<p>
    "The rector preached the sermon," continued his wife; "a beautiful sermon
    it was, too.  I wish you'd been there to hear it; I should 'ave enjoyed
    it ever so much better.  He said that nobody was more surprised than what
    'e was at your doing such a thing, and that it only showed 'ow little we
    knowed our fellow-creatures.  He said that it proved there was good in
    all of us if we only gave it a chance to come out."
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Blows eyed her suspiciously, but she sat thinking and staring at the
    floor.
</p>
<p>
    "I s'pose we shall have to give the money back now," she said, at last.
</p>
<p>
    "Money!" said the other; "what money?"
</p>
<p>
    "Money that was collected for us," replied his wife.  "One 'undered and
    eighty-three pounds seven shillings and fourpence."
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Blows took a long breath.  "Ow much?"  he said, faintly; "say it
    agin."
</p>
<p>
    His wife obeyed.
</p>
<p>
    "Show it to me," said the other, in trembling tones; "let's 'ave a look
    at it.  Let's 'old some of it."
</p>
<p>
    "I can't," was the reply; "there's a committee of the Camels took charge
    of it, and they pay my rent and allow me ten shillings a week.  Now I
    s'pose it'll have to be given back?"
</p>
<p>
    "Don't you talk nonsense," said Mr. Blows, violently.  "You go to them
    interfering Camels and say you want your money&mdash;all of it.  Say you're
    going to Australia.  Say it was my last dying wish."
</p>
<p>
    Mrs. Blows puckered her brow.
</p>
<p>
    "I'll keep quiet upstairs till you've got it," continued her husband,
    rapidly.  "There was only two men saw me, and I can see now that they
    thought I was my own ghost.  Send the kids off to your mother for a few
    days."
</p>
<p>
    His wife sent them off next morning, and a little later was able to tell
    him that his surmise as to his friends' mistake was correct.  All
    Gravelton was thrilled by the news that the spiritual part of Mr. John
    Blows was walking the earth, and much exercised as to his reasons for so
    doing.
</p>
<p>
    "Seemed such a monkey trick for 'im to do," complained Mr. Carter, to the
    listening circle at the Peal o' Bells.  "'I'm a-looking at you, Joe,' he
    ses, and he waggled his 'ead as if it was made of india-rubber."
</p>
<p>
    "He'd got something on 'is mind what he wanted to tell you," said a
    listener, severely; "you ought to 'ave stopped, Joe, and asked 'im what
    it was."
</p>
<p>
    "I think I see myself," said the shivering Mr. Carter.  "I think I see
    myself."
</p>
<p>
    "Then he wouldn't 'ave troubled you any more," said the other.
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Carter turned pale and eyed him fixedly.  "P'r'aps it was only a
    death-warning," said another man.
</p>
<p>
    "What d'ye mean, 'only a death-warning'?"  demanded the unfortunate Mr.
    Carter; "you don't know what you're talking about."
</p>
<p>
    "I 'ad an uncle o' mine see a ghost once," said a third man, anxious to
    relieve the tension.
</p>
<p>
    "And what 'appened?"  inquired the first speaker.  "I'll tell you after
    Joe's gone," said the other, with rare consideration.
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Carter called for some more beer and told the barmaid to put a little
    gin in it.  In a pitiable state of "nerves" he sat at the extreme end of
    a bench, and felt that he was an object of unwholesome interest to his
    acquaintances.  The finishing touch was put to his discomfiture when a
    well-meaning friend in a vague and disjointed way advised him to give up
    drink, swearing, and any other bad habits which he might have contracted.

<p>
    The committee of the Ancient Order of Camels took the news calmly, and
    classed it with pink rats and other abnormalities.  In reply to Mrs.
    Blows's request for the capital sum, they expressed astonishment that she
    could be willing to tear herself away from the hero's grave, and spoke of
    the pain which such an act on her part would cause him in the event of
    his being conscious of it.  In order to show that they were reasonable
    men, they allowed her an extra shilling that week.
</p>
<p>
    The hero threw the dole on the bedroom floor, and in a speech bristling
    with personalities, consigned the committee to perdition.  The
    confinement was beginning to tell upon him, and two nights afterward,
    just before midnight, he slipped out for a breath of fresh air.
</p>
<p>
    It was a clear night, and all Gravelton with one exception, appeared to
    have gone to bed.  The exception was Police-constable Collins, and he,
    after tracking the skulking figure of Mr. Blows and finally bringing it
    to bay in a doorway, kept his for a fort-night.  As a sensible man, Mr.
    Blows took no credit to himself for the circumstance, but a natural
    feeling of satisfaction at the discomfiture of a member of a force for
    which he had long entertained a strong objection could not be denied.
</p>
<p>
    Gravelton debated this new appearance with bated breath, and even the
    purblind committee of the Camels had to alter their views.  They no
    longer denied the supernatural nature of the manifestations, but, with
    a strange misunderstanding of Mr. Blows's desires, attributed his
    restlessness to dissatisfaction with the projected tombstone, and, having
    plenty of funds, amended their order for a plain stone at ten guineas to
    one in pink marble at twenty-five.
</p>
<p>
    "That there committee," said Mr. Blows to his wife, in a trembling voice,
    as he heard of the alteration&mdash;"that there committee seem to think that
    they can play about with my money as they like.  You go and tell 'em you
    won't 'ave it.  And say you've given up the idea of going to Australia
    and you want the money to open a shop with.  We'll take a little pub
    somewhere."
</p>
<p>
    Mrs. Blows went, and returned in tears, and for two entire days her
    husband, a prey to gloom, sat trying to evolve fresh and original ideas
    for the possession of the money.  On the evening of the second day he
    became low-spirited, and going down to the kitchen took a glass from the
    dresser and sat down by the beer-cask.
</p>
<p>
    Almost insensibly he began to take a brighter view of things.  It was
    Saturday night and his wife was out.  He shook his head indulgently as he
    thought of her, and began to realise how foolish he had been to entrust
    such a delicate mission to a woman.  The Ancient Order of Camels wanted a
    man to talk to them&mdash;a man who knew the world and could assail them with
    unanswerable arguments.  Having applied every known test to make sure
    that the cask was empty, he took his cap from a nail and sallied out into
    the street.
</p>
<p>
    Old Mrs. Martin, a neighbour, saw him first, and announced the fact with
    a scream that brought a dozen people round her.  Bereft of speech, she
    mouthed dumbly at Mr. Blows.
</p>
<p>
    "I ain't touch&mdash;touched her," said that gentleman, earnestly.  "I ain't&mdash;
    been near 'er."
</p>
<p>
    The crowd regarded him wild-eyed.  Fresh members came running up, and
    pushing for a front place fell back hastily on the main body and watched
    breathlessly.  Mr. Blows, disquieted by their silence, renewed his
    protestations.
</p>
<p>
    "I was coming 'long&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>
<p>
    He broke off suddenly and, turning round, gazed with some heat at a
    gentleman who was endeavouring to ascertain whether an umbrella would
    pass through him.  The investigator backed hastily into the crowd again,
    and a faint murmur of surprise arose as the indignant Mr. Blows rubbed
    the place.
</p>
<p>
    "He's alive, I tell you," said a voice.  "What cheer, Jack!"
</p>
<p>
    "Ullo, Bill," said Mr. Blows, genially.
</p>
<p>
    Bill came forward cautiously, and, first shaking hands, satisfied himself
    by various little taps and prods that his friend was really alive.
</p>
<p>
    "It's all right," he shouted; "come and feel."
</p>
<p>
    At least fifty hands accepted the invitation, and, ignoring the threats
    and entreaties of Mr. Blows, who was a highly ticklish subject, wandered
    briskly over his anatomy.  He broke free at last and, supported by Bill
    and a friend, set off for the Peal o' Bells.
</p>
<p>
    By the time he arrived there his following had swollen to immense
    proportions.  Windows were thrown up, and people standing on their
    doorsteps shouted inquiries.  Congratulations met him on all sides, and
    the joy of Mr. Joseph Carter was so great that Mr. Blows was quite
    affected.
</p>
<p>
    In high feather at the attention he was receiving, Mr. Blows pushed his
    way through the idlers at the door and ascended the short flight of
    stairs which led to the room where the members of the Ancient Order of
    Camels were holding their lodge.  The crowd swarmed up after him.
</p>
<p>
    The door was locked, but in response to his knocking it opened a couple
    of inches, and a gruff voice demanded his business.  Then, before he
    could give it, the doorkeeper reeled back into the room, and Mr. Blows
    with a large following pushed his way in.
</p>
<p>
    The president and his officers, who were sitting in state behind a long
    table at the end of the room, started to their feet with mingled cries of
    indignation and dismay at the intrusion.  Mr. Blows, conscious of the
    strength of his position, walked up to them.

<p>
    "Mr. Blows!"  gasped the president.
</p>
<p>
    "Ah, you didn't expec' see me," said Mr. Blows, with a scornful laugh
    "They're trying do me, do me out o' my lill bit o' money, Bill."
</p>
<p>
    "But you ain't got no money," said his bewildered friend.
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Blows turned and eyed him haughtily; then he confronted the staring
    president again.
</p>
<p>
    "I've come for&mdash;my money," he said, impressively&mdash;"one 'under-eighty
    pounds."
</p>
<p>
    "But look 'ere," said the scandalised Bill, tugging at his sleeve; "you
    ain't dead, Jack."
</p>
<p>
    "You don't understan'," said Mr. Blows, impatiently.  "They know wharri
    mean; one 'undereighty pounds.  They want to buy me a tombstone, an' I
    don't want it.  I want the money.  Here, stop it! <i>Dye hear?</i>"  The words
    were wrung from him by the action of the president, who, after eyeing him
    doubtfully during his remarks, suddenly prodded him with the butt-end of
    one of the property spears which leaned against his chair.  The solidity
    of Mr. Blows was unmistakable, and with a sudden resumption of dignity
    the official seated himself and called for silence.
</p>
<p>
    "I'm sorry to say there's been a bit of a mistake made," he said, slowly,
    "but I'm glad to say that Mr. Blows has come back to support his wife and
    family with the sweat of his own brow.  Only a pound or two of the money
    so kindly subscribed has been spent, and the remainder will be handed
    back to the subscribers."
</p>
<p>
    "Here," said the incensed Mr. Blows, "listen me."
</p>
<p>
    "Take him away," said the president, with great dignity.  "Clear the
    room.  Strangers outside."
</p>
<p>
    Two of the members approached Mr. Blows and, placing their hands on his
    shoulders, requested him to withdraw.  He went at last, the centre of a
    dozen panting men, and becoming wedged on the narrow staircase, spoke
    fluently on such widely differing subjects as the rights of man and the
    shape of the president's nose.
</p>
<p>
    He finished his remarks in the street, but, becoming aware at last of a
    strange lack of sympathy on the part of his audience, he shook off the
    arm of the faithful Mr. Carter and stalked moodily home.

    THE THIRD STRING

<p>
    Love?  said the night-watchman, as he watched in an abstracted fashion
    the efforts of a skipper to reach a brother skipper on a passing barge
    with a boathook.  Don't talk to me about love, because I've suffered
    enough through it.  There ought to be teetotalers for love the same as
    wot there is for drink, and they ought to wear a piece o' ribbon to show
    it, the same as the teetotalers do; but not an attractive piece o'
    ribbon, mind you.  I've seen as much mischief caused by love as by drink,
    and the funny thing is, one often leads to the other.  Love, arter it is
    over, often leads to drink, and drink often leads to love and to a man
    committing himself for life afore it is over.

<p>
    Sailormen give way to it most; they see so little o' wimmen that
    they naturally 'ave a high opinion of 'em.  Wait till they become
    night-watchmen and, having to be at 'ome all day, see the other side of
    'em.  If people on'y started life as night-watchmen there wouldn't be one
    'arf the falling in love that there is now.
</p>
<p>
    I remember one chap, as nice a fellow as you could wish to meet, too.
    He always carried his sweet-heart's photograph about with 'im, and it was
    the on'y thing that cheered 'im up during the fourteen years he was cast
    away on a deserted island.  He was picked up at last and taken 'ome, and
    there she was still single and waiting for 'im; and arter spending
    fourteen years on a deserted island he got another ten in quod for
    shooting 'er because she 'ad altered so much in 'er looks.
</p>
<p>
    Then there was Ginger Dick, a red-'aired man I've spoken about before.
    He went and fell in love one time when he was lodging in Wapping 'ere
    with old Sam Small and Peter Russet, and a nice mess 'e made of it.
</p>
<p>
    They was just back from a v'y'ge, and they 'adn't been ashore a week
    afore both of 'em noticed a change for the worse in Ginger.  He turned
    quiet and peaceful and lost 'is taste for beer.  He used to play with 'is
    food instead of eating it, and in place of going out of an evening with
    Sam and Peter took to going off by 'imself.
</p>
<p>
    "It's love," ses Peter Russet, shaking his 'ead, "and he'll be worse
    afore he's better."
</p>
<p>
    "Who's the gal?" ses old Sam.
</p>
<p>
    Peter didn't know, but when they came 'ome that night 'e asked.  Ginger,
    who was sitting up in bed with a far-off look in 'is eyes, cuddling 'is
    knees, went on staring but didn't answer.
</p>
<p>
    "Who is it making a fool of you this time, Ginger?" ses old Sam.
</p>
<p>
    "You mind your bisness and I'll mind mine," ses Ginger, suddenly waking
    up and looking very fierce.
</p>
<p>
    "No offence, mate," ses Sam, winking at Peter.  "I on'y asked in case I
    might be able to do you a good turn."
</p>
<p>
    "Well, you can do that by not letting her know you're a pal o' mine," ses
    Ginger, very nasty.
</p>
<p>
    Old Sam didn't understand at fust, and when Peter explained to 'im he
    wanted to hit 'im for trying to twist Ginger's words about.
</p>
<p>
    "She don't like fat old men," ses Ginger.
</p>
<p>
    "Ho!" ses old Sam, who couldn't think of anything else to say.  "Ho!
    don't she?  Ho!  Ho! indeed!"
</p>
<p>
    He undressed 'imself and got into the bed he shared with Peter, and kept
    'im awake for hours by telling 'im in a loud voice about all the gals
    he'd made love to in his life, and partikler about one gal that always
    fainted dead away whenever she saw either a red-'aired man or a monkey.
</p>
<p>
    Peter Russet found out all about it next day, and told Sam that it was a
    barmaid with black 'air and eyes at the Jolly Pilots, and that she
    wouldn't 'ave anything to say to Ginger.
</p>
<p>
    He spoke to Ginger about it agin when they were going to bed that night,
    and to 'is surprise found that he was quite civil.  When 'e said that he
    would do anything he could for 'im, Ginger was quite affected.
</p>
<p>
    "I can't eat or drink," he ses, in a miserable voice; "I lay awake all
    last night thinking of her.  She's so diff'rent to other gals; she's
    got&mdash;If I start on you, Sam Small, you'll know it.  You go and make that
    choking noise to them as likes it."
</p>
<p>
    "It's a bit o' egg-shell I got in my throat at break-fast this morning,
    Ginger," ses Sam.  "I wonder whether she lays awake all night thinking of
    you?"
</p>
<p>
    "I dare say she does," ses Peter Russet, giving 'im a little push.
</p>
<p>
    "Keep your 'art up, Ginger," ses Sam; "I've known gals to 'ave the most
    ext'ordinary likings afore now."
</p>
<p>
    "Don't take no notice of 'im," ses Peter, holding Ginger back.  "'Ow are
    you getting on with her?"
</p>
<p>
    Ginger groaned and sat down on 'is bed and looked at the floor, and Sam
    went and sat on his till it shook so that Ginger offered to step over and
    break 'is neck for 'im.
</p>
<p>
    "I can't 'elp the bed shaking," ses Sam; "it ain't my fault.  I didn't
    make it.  If being in love is going to make you so disagreeable to your
    best friends, Ginger, you'd better go and live by yourself."
</p>
<p>
    "I 'eard something about her to-day, Ginger," ses Peter Russet.  "I met a
    chap I used to know at Bull's Wharf, and he told me that she used to keep
    company with a chap named Bill Lumm, a bit of a prize-fighter, and since
    she gave 'im up she won't look at anybody else."
</p>
<p>
    "Was she very fond of 'im, then?" asks Ginger.
</p>
<p>
    "I don't know," ses Peter; "but this chap told me that she won't walk out
    with anybody agin, unless it's another prize-fighter.  Her pride won't
    let her, I s'pose."
</p>
<p>
    "Well, that's all right, Ginger," ses Sam; "all you've got to do is to go
    and be a prize-fighter."
</p>
<p>
    "If I 'ave any more o' your nonsense&mdash;" ses Ginger, starting up.
</p>
<p>
    "That's right," ses Sam; "jump down anybody's throat when they're trying
    to do you a kindness.  That's you all over, Ginger, that is.  Wot's to
    prevent you telling 'er that you're a prize-fighter from Australia or
    somewhere?  She won't know no better."
</p>
<p>
    He got up off the bed and put his 'ands up as Ginger walked across the
    room to 'im, but Ginger on'y wanted to shake 'ands, and arter he 'ad done
    that 'e patted 'im on the back and smiled at 'im.
</p>
<p>
    "I'll try it," he ses.  "I'd tell any lies for 'er sake.  Ah! you don't
    know wot love is, Sam."
</p>
<p>
    "I used to," ses Sam, and then he sat down agin and began to tell 'em all
    the love-affairs he could remember, until at last Peter Russet got tired
    and said it was 'ard to believe, looking at 'im now, wot a perfick terror
    he'd been with gals, and said that the face he'd got now was a judgment
    on 'im.  Sam shut up arter that, and got into trouble with Peter in the
    middle o' the night by waking 'im up to tell 'im something that he 'ad
    just thought of about his face.
</p>
<p>
    The more Ginger thought o' Sam's idea the more he liked it, and the very
    next evening 'e took Peter Russet into the private bar o' the Jolly
    Pilots.  He ordered port wine, which he thought seemed more 'igh-class
    than beer, and then Peter Russet started talking to Miss Tucker and told
    her that Ginger was a prize-fighter from Sydney, where he'd beat
    everybody that stood up to 'im.
</p>
<p>
    The gal seemed to change toward Ginger all in a flash, and 'er beautiful
    black eyes looked at 'im so admiring that he felt quite faint.  She
    started talking to 'im about his fights at once, and when at last 'e
    plucked up courage to ask 'er to go for a walk with 'im on Sunday
    arternoon she seemed quite delighted.
</p>
<p>
    "It'll be a nice change for me," she ses, smiling.  "I used to walk out
    with a prize-fighter once before, and since I gave 'im up I began to
    think I was never going to 'ave a young man agin.  You can't think 'ow
    dull it's been."
</p>
<p>
    "Must ha' been," ses Ginger.
</p>
<p>
    "I s'pose you've got a taste for prize-fighters, miss," ses Peter Russet.
</p>
<p>
    "No," ses Miss Tucker; "I don't think that it's that exactly, but, you
    see, I couldn't 'ave anybody else.  Not for their own sakes."

<p>
    "Why not?" ses Ginger, looking puzzled.
</p>
<p>
    "Why not?" ses Miss Tucker.  "Why, because o' Bill.  He's such a 'orrid
    jealous disposition.  After I gave 'im up I walked out with a young
    fellow named Smith; fine, big, strapping chap 'e was, too, and I never
    saw such a change in any man as there was in 'im after Bill 'ad done with
    'im.  I couldn't believe it was 'im.  I told Bill he ought to be ashamed
    of 'imself."
</p>
<p>
    "Wot did 'e say?"  asks Ginger.
</p>
<p>
    "Don't ask me wot 'e said," ses Miss Tucker, tossing her 'ead.  "Not
    liking to be beat, I 'ad one more try with a young fellow named Charlie
    Webb."
</p>
<p>
    "Wot 'appened to 'im?" ses Peter Russet, arter waiting a bit for 'er to
    finish.
</p>
<p>
    "I can't bear to talk of it," ses Miss Tucker, holding up Ginger's glass
    and giving the counter a wipe down.  "He met Bill, and I saw 'im six
    weeks afterward just as 'e was being sent away from the 'ospital to a
    seaside home.  Bill disappeared after that."
</p>
<p>
    "Has he gone far away?" ses Ginger, trying to speak in a off-'and way.
</p>
<p>
    "Oh, he's back now," ses Miss Tucker.  "You'll see 'im fast enough, and,
    wotever you do, don't let 'im know you're a prize-fighter."
</p>
<p>
    "Why not?" ses pore Ginger.
</p>
<p>
    "Because o' the surprise it'll be to 'im," ses Miss Tucker.  "Let 'im
    rush on to 'is doom.  He'll get a lesson 'e don't expect, the bully.
    Don't be afraid of 'urting 'im.  Think o' pore Smith and Charlie Webb."
</p>
<p>
    "I am thinkin' of 'em," ses Ginger, slow-like.  "Is&mdash;is Bill&mdash;very quick
    &mdash;with his 'ands?"
</p>
<p>
    "Rather," ses Miss Tucker; "but o' course he ain't up to your mark; he's
    on'y known in these parts."
</p>
<p>
    She went off to serve a customer, and Ginger Dick tried to catch Peter's
    eye, but couldn't, and when Miss Tucker came back he said 'e must be
    going.
</p>
<p>
    "Sunday afternoon at a quarter past three sharp, outside 'ere," she ses.
    "Never mind about putting on your best clothes, because Bill is sure to
    be hanging about.  I'll take care o' that."
</p>
<p>
    She reached over the bar and shook 'ands with 'im, and Ginger felt a
    thrill go up 'is arm which lasted 'im all the way 'ome.
</p>
<p>
    He didn't know whether to turn up on Sunday or not, and if it 'adn't ha'
    been for Sam and Peter Russet he'd ha' most likely stayed at home.  Not
    that 'e was a coward, being always ready for a scrap and gin'rally
    speaking doing well at it, but he made a few inquiries about Bill Lumm
    and 'e saw that 'e had about as much chance with 'im as a kitten would
    'ave with a bulldog.
</p>
<p>
    Sam and Peter was delighted, and they talked about it as if it was a
    pantermime, and old Sam said that when he was a young man he'd ha' fought
    six Bill Lumms afore he'd ha' given a gal up.  He brushed Ginger's
    clothes for 'im with 'is own hands on Sunday afternoon, and, when Ginger
    started, 'im and Peter follered some distance behind to see fair play.
</p>
<p>
    The on'y person outside the Jolly Pilots when Ginger got there was a man;
    a strong-built chap with a thick neck, very large 'ands, and a nose which
    'ad seen its best days some time afore.  He looked 'ard at Ginger as 'e
    came up, and then stuck his 'ands in 'is trouser pockets and spat on the
    pavement.  Ginger walked a little way past and then back agin, and just
    as he was thinking that 'e might venture to go off, as Miss Tucker 'adn't
    come, the door opened and out she came.
</p>
<p>
    "I couldn't find my 'at-pins," she ses, taking Ginger's arm and smiling
    up into 'is face.
</p>
<p>
    Before Ginger could say anything the man he 'ad noticed took his 'ands
    out of 'is pockets and stepped up to 'im.
</p>
<p>
    "Let go o' that young lady's arm," he ses.  "Sha'n't," ses Ginger,
    holding it so tight that Miss Tucker nearly screamed.
</p>
<p>
    "Let go 'er arm and put your 'ands up," ses the chap agin.

<p>
    "Not 'ere," ses Ginger, who 'ad laid awake the night afore thinking wot
    to do if he met Bill Lumm.  "If you wish to 'ave a spar with me, my lad,
    you must 'ave it where we can't be interrupted.  When I start on a man I
    like to make a good job of it."
</p>
<p>
    "Good job of it!" ses the other, starting.  "Do you know who I am?"
</p>
<p>
    "No, I don't," ses Ginger, "and, wot's more, I don't care."
</p>
<p>
    "My name," ses the chap, speaking in a slow, careful voice, "is Bill
    Lumm."
</p>
<p>
    "Wot a 'orrid name!" ses Ginger.
</p>
<p>
    "Otherwise known as the Wapping Basher," ses Bill, shoving 'is face into
    Ginger's and glaring at 'im.
</p>
<p>
    "Ho!" ses Ginger, sniffing, "a amatoor."
</p>
<p>
    "<i>Amatoor?</i>"  ses Bill, shouting.
</p>
<p>
    "That's wot we should call you over in Australia," ses Ginger; "my name
    is Dick Duster, likewise known as the Sydney Puncher.  I've killed three
    men in the ring and 'ave never 'ad a defeat."
</p>
<p>
    "Well, put 'em up," ses Bill, doubling up 'is fists and shaping at 'im.
</p>
<p>
    "Not in the street, I tell you," ses Ginger, still clinging tight to Miss
    Tucker's arm.  "I was fined five pounds the other day for punching a man
    in the street, and the magistrate said it would be 'ard labour for me
    next time.  You find a nice, quiet spot for some arternoon, and I'll
    knock your 'ead off with pleasure."
</p>
<p>
    "I'd sooner 'ave it knocked off now," ses Bill; "I don't like waiting for
    things."
</p>
<p>
    "Thursday arternoon," ses Ginger, very firm; "there's one or two
    gentlemen want to see a bit o' my work afore backing me, and we can
    combine bisness with pleasure."
</p>
<p>
    He walked off with Miss Tucker, leaving Bill Lumm standing on the
    pavement scratching his 'ead and staring arter 'im as though 'e didn't
    quite know wot to make of it.  Bill stood there for pretty near five
    minutes, and then arter asking Sam and Peter, who 'ad been standing by
    listening, whether they wanted anything for themselves, walked off to ask
    'is pals wot they knew about the Sydney Puncher.
</p>
<p>
    Ginger Dick was so quiet and satisfied about the fight that old Sam and
    Peter couldn't make 'im out at all.  He wouldn't even practise punching
    at a bolster that Peter rigged up for 'im, and when 'e got a message from
    Bill Lumm naming a quiet place on the Lea Marshes he agreed to it as
    comfortable as possible.
</p>
<p>
    "Well, I must say, Ginger, that I like your pluck," ses Peter Russet.
</p>
<p>
    "I always 'ave said that for Ginger; 'e's got pluck," ses Sam.
</p>
<p>
    Ginger coughed and tried to smile at 'em in a superior sort o' way.  "I
    thought you'd got more sense," he ses, at last.  "You don't think I'm
    going, do you?"
</p>
<p>
    "Wot?" ses old Sam, in a shocked voice.
</p>
<p>
    "You're never going to back out of it, Ginger?"  ses Peter.
</p>
<p>
    "I am," ses Ginger.  "If you think I'm going to be smashed up by a
    prize-fighter just to show my pluck you're mistook."
</p>
<p>
    "You must go, Ginger," ses old Sam, very severe.  "It's too late to back
    out of it now.  Think of the gal.  Think of 'er feelings."
</p>
<p>
    "For the sake of your good name," ses Peter.
</p>
<p>
    "I should never speak to you agin, Ginger," ses old Sam, pursing up 'is
    lips.
</p>
<p>
    "Nor me neither," ses Peter Russet.
</p>
<p>
    "To think of our Ginger being called a coward," ses old Sam, with a
    shudder, "and afore a gal, too."
</p>
<p>
    "The loveliest gal in Wapping," ses Peter.
</p>
<p>
    "Look 'ere," ses Ginger, "you can shut up, both of you.  I'm not going,
    and that's the long and short of it.  I don't mind an ordinary man, but I
    draw the line at prize-fighters."
</p>
<p>
    Old Sam sat down on the edge of 'is bed and looked the picture of
    despair.  "You must go, Ginger," he ses, "for my sake."
</p>
<p>
    "Your sake?"  ses Ginger, staring.
</p>
<p>
    "I've got money on it," ses Sam, "so's Peter.  If you don't turn up all
    bets'll be off."
</p>
<p>
    "Good job for you, too," ses Ginger.  "If I did turn up you'd lose it, to
    a dead certainty."
</p>
<p>
    Old Sam coughed and looked at Peter, and Peter 'e coughed and looked at
    Sam.
</p>
<p>
    "You don't understand, Ginger," said Sam, in a soft voice; "it ain't
    often a chap gets the chance o' making a bit o' money these 'ard times."
</p>
<p>
    "So we've put all our money on Bill Lumm," ses Peter.  "It's the safest
    and easiest way o' making money I ever 'eard of.  You see, we know you're
    not a prize-fighter and the others don't."
</p>
<p>
    Pore Ginger looked at 'em, and then 'e called 'em all the names he could
    lay 'is tongue to, but, with the idea o' the money they was going make,
    they didn't mind a bit.  They let him 'ave 'is say, and that night they
    brought 'ome two other sailormen wot 'ad bet agin Ginger to share their
    room, and, though they 'ad bet agin 'im, they was so fond of 'im that it
    was evident that they wasn't going to leave 'im till the fight was over.
</p>
<p>
    Ginger gave up then, and at twelve o'clock next day they started off to
    find the place.  Mr. Webson, the landlord of the Jolly Pilots, a short,
    fat man o' fifty, wot 'ad spoke to Ginger once or twice, went with 'em,
    and all the way to the station he kept saying wot a jolly spot it was for
    that sort o' thing.  Perfickly private; nice soft green grass to be
    knocked down on, and larks up in the air singing away as if they'd never
    leave off.
</p>
<p>
    They took the train to Homerton, and, being a slack time o' the day, the
    porters was surprised to see wot a lot o' people was travelling by it.
    So was Ginger.  There was the landlords of 'arf the public-'ouses in
    Wapping, all smoking big cigars; two dock policemen in plain clothes, wot
    'ad got the arternoon off&mdash;one with a raging toothache and the other with
    a baby wot wasn't expected to last the day out.  They was as full o' fun
    as kittens, and the landlord o' the Jolly Pilots pointed out to Ginger
    wot reasonable 'uman beings policemen was at 'art.  Besides them there
    was quite a lot o' sailormen, even skippers and mates, nearly all of 'em
    smoking big cigars, too, and looking at Ginger out of the corner of one
    eye and at the Wapping Basher out of the corner of the other.
</p>
<p>
    "Hit 'ard and hit straight," ses the landlord to Ginger in a low voice,
    as they got out of the train and walked up the road.  "'Ow are you
    feeling?"
</p>
<p>
    "I've got a cold coming on," ses pore Ginger, looking at the Basher, who
    was on in front, "and a splitting 'eadache, and a sharp pain all down my
    left leg.  I don't think&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>
<p>
    "Well, it's a good job it's no worse," ses the land-lord; "all you've got
    to do is to hit 'ard.  If you win it's a 'undered pounds in my pocket,
    and I'll stand you a fiver of it.  D'ye understand?"
</p>
<p>
    They turned down some little streets, several of 'em going diff'rent
    ways, and arter crossing the River Lea got on to the marshes, and, as the
    landlord said, the place might ha' been made for it.
</p>
<p>
    A little chap from Mile End was the referee, and Bill Lumm, 'aving
    peeled, stood looking on while Ginger took 'is things off and slowly and
    carefully folded 'em up.  Then they stepped toward each other, Bill
    taking longer steps than Ginger, and shook 'ands; immediately arter which
    Bill knocked Ginger head over 'eels.

<p>
    "Time!" was called, and the landlord o' the Jolly Pilots, who was nursing
    Ginger on 'is knee, said that it was nothing at all, and that bleeding at
    the nose was a sign of 'ealth.  But as it happened Ginger was that mad 'e
    didn't want any encouragement, he on'y wanted to kill Bill Lumm.
</p>
<p>
    He got two or three taps in the next round which made his 'ead ring, and
    then he got 'ome on the mark and follered it up by a left-'anded punch on
    Bill's jaw that surprised 'em both&mdash;Bill because he didn't think Ginger
    could hit so 'ard, and Ginger because 'e didn't think that prize-fighters
    'ad any feelings.
</p>
<p>
    They clinched and fell that round, and the land-lord patted Ginger on the
    back and said that if he ever 'ad a son he 'oped he'd grow up like 'im.
</p>
<p>
    Ginger was surprised at the way 'e was getting on, and so was old Sam and
    Peter Russet, and when Ginger knocked Bill down in the sixth round Sam
    went as pale as death.  Ginger was getting marked all over, but he stuck,
    to 'is man, and the two dock policemen, wot 'ad put their money on Bill
    Lumm, began to talk of their dooty, and say as 'ow the fight ought to be
    stopped.
</p>
<p>
    At the tenth round Bill couldn't see out of 'is eyes, and kept wasting
    'is strength on the empty air, and once on the referee.  Ginger watched
    'is opportunity, and at last, with a terrific smash on the point o'
    Bill's jaw, knocked 'im down and then looked round for the landlord's
    knee.
</p>
<p>
    Bill made a game try to get up when "Time!"  was called, but couldn't;
    and the referee, who was 'olding a 'andkerchief to 'is nose, gave the
    fight to Ginger.
</p>
<p>
    It was the proudest moment o' Ginger Dick's life.  He sat there like a
    king, smiling 'orribly, and Sam's voice as he paid 'is losings sounded to
    'im like music, in spite o' the words the old man see fit to use.  It was
    so 'ard to get Peter Russet's money that it a'most looked as though there
    was going to be another prize-fight, but 'e paid up at last and went off,
    arter fust telling Ginger part of wot he thought of 'im.
</p>
<p>
    There was a lot o' quarrelling, but the bets was all settled at last, and
    the landlord o' the Jolly Pilots, who was in 'igh feather with the money
    he'd won, gave Ginger the five pounds he'd promised and took him 'ome in
    a cab.
</p>
<p>
    "You done well, my lad," he ses.  "No, don't smile.  It looks as though
    your 'ead's coming off."
</p>
<p>
    "I 'ope you'll tell Miss Tucker 'ow I fought," ses Ginger.
</p>
<p>
    "I will, my lad," ses the landlord; "but you'd better not see 'er for
    some time, for both your sakes."
</p>
<p>
    "I was thinking of 'aving a day or two in bed," ses Ginger.
</p>
<p>
    "Best thing you can do," ses the landlord; "and mind, don't you ever
    fight Bill Lumm agin.  Keep out of 'is way."
</p>
<p>
    "Why?  I beat 'im once, an' I can beat 'im agin," ses Ginger, offended.
</p>
<p>
    "Beat 'im?" ses the landlord.  He took 'is cigar out of 'is mouth as
    though 'e was going to speak, and then put it back agin and looked out
    of the window.
</p>
<p>
    "Yes, beat 'im," ses Ginger'.  "You was there and saw it."
</p>
<p>
    "He lost the fight a-purpose," ses the landlord, whispering.  "Miss
    Tucker found out that you wasn't a prize-fighter&mdash;leastways, I did for
    'er&mdash;and she told Bill that, if 'e loved 'er so much that he'd 'ave 'is
    sinful pride took down by letting you beat 'im, she'd think diff'rent of
    'im.  Why, 'e could 'ave settled you in a minute if he'd liked.  He was
    on'y playing with you."
</p>
<p>
    Ginger stared at 'im as if 'e couldn't believe 'is eyes.  "Playing?"  he
    ses, feeling 'is face very gently with the tips of his fingers.
</p>
<p>
    "Yes," ses the landlord; "and if he ever hits you agin you'll know I'm
    speaking the truth."
</p>
<p>
    Ginger sat back all of a heap and tried to think.  "Is Miss Tucker going
    to keep company with 'im agin, then?"  he ses, in a faint voice.
</p>
<p>
    "No," ses the landlord; "you can make your mind easy on that point."
</p>
<p>
    "Well, then, if I walk out with 'er I shall 'ave to fight Bill all over
    agin," ses Ginger.
</p>
<p>
    The landlord turned to 'im and patted 'im on the shoulder.  "Don't you
    take up your troubles afore they come, my lad," he ses, kindly; "and mind
    and keep wot I've told you dark, for all our sakes."
</p>
<p>
    He put 'im down at the door of 'is lodgings and, arter shaking 'ands with
    'im, gave the landlady a shilling and told 'er to get some beefsteak and
    put on 'is face, and went home.  Ginger went straight off to bed, and the
    way he carried on when the landlady fried the steak afore bringing it up
    showed 'ow upset he was.

<p>
    It was over a week afore he felt 'e could risk letting Miss Tucker see
    'im, and then at seven o'clock one evening he felt 'e couldn't wait any
    longer, and arter spending an hour cleaning 'imself he started out for
    the Jolly Pilots.
</p>
<p>
    He felt so 'appy at the idea o' seeing her agin that 'e forgot all about
    Bill Lumm, and it gave 'im quite a shock when 'e saw 'im standing outside
    the Pilots.  Bill took his 'ands out of 'is pockets when he saw 'im and
    came toward 'im.
</p>
<p>
    "It's no good to-night, mate," he ses; and to Ginger's great surprise
    shook 'ands with 'im.
</p>
<p>
    "No good?" ses Ginger, staring.
</p>
<p>
    "No," ses Bill; "he's in the little back-parlour, like a whelk in 'is
    shell; but we'll 'ave 'im sooner or later."
</p>
<p>
    "Him?  Who?"  ses Ginger, more puzzled than ever.
</p>
<p>
    "Who?" ses Bill; "why, Webson, the landlord.  You don't mean to tell me
    you ain't heard about it?"
</p>
<p>
    "Heard wot?" ses Ginger.  "I haven't 'card any-thing.  I've been indoors
    with a bad cold all the week."
</p>
<p>
    "Webson and Julia Tucker was married at eleven o'clock yesterday
    morning," ses Bill Lumm, in a hoarse voice.  "When I think of the way
    I've been done, and wot I've suffered, I feel 'arf crazy.  He won a
    'undered pounds through me, and then got the gal I let myself be
    disgraced for.  I 'ad an idea some time ago that he'd got 'is eye on
    her."
</p>
<p>
    Ginger Dick didn't answer 'im a word.  He staggered back and braced
    'imself up agin the wall for a bit, and arter staring at Bill Lumm in a
    wild way for pretty near three minutes he crawled back to 'is lodgings
    and went straight to bed agin.

    ODD CHARGES
</h2>
<p>
    Seated at his ease in the warm tap-room of the Cauliflower, the stranger
    had been eating and drinking for some time, apparently unconscious of the
    presence of the withered ancient who, huddled up in that corner of the
    settle which was nearer to the fire, fidgeted restlessly with an empty
    mug and blew with pathetic insistence through a churchwarden pipe which
    had long been cold.  The stranger finished his meal with a sigh of
    content and then, rising from his chair, crossed over to the settle and,
    placing his mug on the time-worn table before him, began to fill his
    pipe.

<p>
    The old man took a spill from the table and, holding it with trembling
    fingers to the blaze, gave him a light.  The other thanked him, and then,
    leaning back in his corner of the settle, watched the smoke of his pipe
    through half-closed eyes, and assented drowsily to the old man's remarks
    upon the weather.
</p>
<p>
    "Bad time o' the year for going about," said the latter, "though I s'pose
    if you can eat and drink as much as you want it don't matter.  I s'pose
    you mightn't be a conjurer from London, sir?"
</p>
<p>
    The traveller shook his head.
</p>
<p>
    "I was 'oping you might be," said the old man.  The other manifested no
    curiosity.
</p>
<p>
    "If you 'ad been," said the old man, with a sigh, "I should ha' asked you
    to ha' done something useful.  Gin'rally speaking, conjurers do things
    that are no use to anyone; wot I should like to see a conjurer do would
    be to make this 'ere empty mug full o' beer and this empty pipe full o'
    shag tobacco.  That's wot I should ha' made bold to ask you to do if
    you'd been one."
</p>
<p>
    The traveller sighed, and, taking his short briar pipe from his mouth by
    the bowl, rapped three times upon the table with it.  In a very short
    time a mug of ale and a paper cylinder of shag appeared on the table
    before the old man.
</p>
<p>
    "Wot put me in mind o' your being a conjurer," said the latter, filling
    his pipe after a satisfying draught from the mug, "is that you're
    uncommon like one that come to Claybury some time back and give a
    performance in this very room where we're now a-sitting.  So far as
    looks go, you might be his brother."
</p>
<p>
    The traveller said that he never had a brother.
</p>
<p>
    We didn't know 'e was a conjurer at fust, said the old man.  He 'ad come
    down for Wickham Fair and, being a day or two before 'and, 'e was going
    to different villages round about to give performances.  He came into the
    bar 'ere and ordered a mug o' beer, and while 'e was a-drinking of it
    stood talking about the weather.  Then 'e asked Bill Chambers to excuse
    'im for taking the liberty, and, putting his 'and to Bill's mug, took out
    a live frog.  Bill was a very partikler man about wot 'e drunk, and I
    thought he'd ha' had a fit.  He went on at Smith, the landlord, something
    shocking, and at last, for the sake o' peace and quietness, Smith gave
    'im another pint to make up for it.

</center>
<!--IMAGE END-->
<p>
    "It must ha' been asleep in the mug," he ses.
</p>
<p>
    Bill said that 'e thought 'e knew who must ha' been asleep, and was just
    going to take a drink, when the conjurer asked 'im to excuse 'im agin.
    Bill put down the mug in a 'urry, and the conjurer put his 'and to the
    mug and took out a dead mouse.  It would ha' been a 'ard thing to say
    which was the most upset, Bill Chambers or Smith, the landlord, and Bill,
    who was in a terrible state, asked why it was everything seemed to get
    into his mug.
</p>
<p>
    "P'r'aps you're fond o' dumb animals, sir," ses the conjurer.  "Do you
    'appen to notice your coat-pocket is all of a wriggle?"
</p>
<p>
    He put his 'and to Bill's pocket and took out a little green snake; then
    he put his 'and to Bill's trouser-pocket and took out a frog, while pore
    Bill's eyes looked as if they was corning out o' their sockets.
</p>
<p>
    "Keep still," ses the conjurer; "there's a lot more to come yet."
</p>
<p>
    Bill Chambers gave a 'owl that was dreadful to listen to, and then 'e
    pushed the conjurer away and started undressing 'imself as fast as he
    could move 'is fingers.  I believe he'd ha' taken off 'is shirt if it 'ad
    'ad pockets in it, and then 'e stuck 'is feet close together and 'e kept
    jumping into the air, and coming down on to 'is own clothes in his
    hobnailed boots.
</p>
<p>
    "He ain't fond o' dumb animals, then," ses the conjurer.  Then he put his
    'and on his 'art and bowed.
</p>
<p>
    "Gentlemen all," he ses.  "'Aving given you this specimen of wot I can
    do, I beg to give notice that with the landlord's kind permission I shall
    give my celebrated conjuring entertainment in the tap-room this evening
    at seven o'clock; ad&mdash;mission, three-pence each."
</p>
<p>
    They didn't understand 'im at fust, but at last they see wot 'e meant,
    and arter explaining to Bill, who was still giving little jumps, they led
    'im up into a corner and coaxed 'im into dressing 'imself agin.  He wanted
    to fight the conjurer, but 'e was that tired 'e could scarcely stand, and
    by-and-by Smith, who 'ad said 'e wouldn't 'ave anything to do with it,
    gave way and said he'd risk it.
</p>
<p>
    The tap-room was crowded that night, but we all 'ad to pay threepence
    each&mdash;coining money, I call it.  Some o' the things wot he done was very
    clever, but a'most from the fust start-off there was unpleasantness.
    When he asked somebody to lend 'im a pocket-'andkercher to turn into a
    white rabbit, Henery Walker rushed up and lent 'im 'is, but instead of a
    white rabbit it turned into a black one with two white spots on it, and
    arter Henery Walker 'ad sat for some time puzzling over it 'e got up and
    went off 'ome without saying good-night to a soul.
</p>
<p>
    Then the conjurer borrowed Sam Jones's hat, and arter looking into it for
    some time 'e was that surprised and astonished that Sam Jones lost 'is
    temper and asked 'im whether he 'adn't seen a hat afore.
</p>
<p>
    "Not like this," ses the conjurer.  And 'e pulled out a woman's dress and
    jacket and a pair o' boots.  Then 'e took out a pound or two o' taters
    and some crusts o' bread and other things, and at last 'e gave it back to
    Sam Jones and shook 'is head at 'im, and told 'im if he wasn't very
    careful he'd spoil the shape of it.
</p>
<p>
    Then 'e asked somebody to lend 'im a watch, and, arter he 'ad promised to
    take the greatest care of it, Dicky Weed, the tailor, lent 'im a gold
    watch wot 'ad been left 'im by 'is great-aunt when she died.  Dicky Weed
    thought a great deal o' that watch, and when the conjurer took a
    flat-iron and began to smash it up into little bits it took three men
    to hold 'im down in 'is seat.
</p>
<p>
    "This is the most difficult trick o' the lot," ses the conjurer, picking
    off a wheel wot 'ad stuck to the flat-iron.  "Sometimes I can do it and
    sometimes I can't.  Last time I tried it it was a failure, and it cost me
    eighteenpence and a pint o' beer afore the gentleman the watch 'ad
    belonged to was satisfied.  I gave 'im the bits, too."
</p>
<p>
    "If you don't give me my watch back safe and sound," ses Dicky Weed, in a
    trembling voice, "it'll cost you twenty pounds."
</p>
<p>
    "'Ow much?" ses the conjurer, with a start.  "Well, I wish you'd told me
    that afore you lent it to me.  Eighteenpence is my price."
</p>
<p>
    He stirred the broken bits up with 'is finger and shook his 'ead.
</p>
<p>
    "I've never tried one o' these old-fashioned watches afore," he ses.
    "'Owever, if I fail, gentle-men, it'll be the fust and only trick I've
    failed in to-night.  You can't expect everything to turn out right, but
    if I do fail this time, gentlemen, I'll try it agin if anybody else'll
    lend me another watch."
</p>
<p>
    Dicky Weed tried to speak but couldn't, and 'e sat there, with 'is face
    pale, staring at the pieces of 'is watch on the conjurer's table.  Then
    the conjurer took a big pistol with a trumpet-shaped barrel out of 'is
    box, and arter putting in a charge o' powder picked up the pieces o'
    watch and rammed them in arter it.  We could hear the broken bits grating
    agin the ramrod, and arter he 'ad loaded it 'e walked round and handed it
    to us to look at.
</p>
<p>
    "It's all right," he ses to Dicky Weed; "it's going to be a success; I
    could tell in the loading."
</p>
<p>
    He walked back to the other end of the room and held up the pistol.
</p>
<p>
    "I shall now fire this pistol," 'e ses, "and in so doing mend the watch.
    The explosion of the powder makes the bits o' glass join together agin;
    in flying through the air the wheels go round and round collecting all
    the other parts, and the watch as good as new and ticking away its
    'ardest will be found in the coat-pocket o' the gentleman I shoot at."
</p>
<p>
    He pointed the pistol fust at one and then at another, as if 'e couldn't
    make up 'is mind, and none of 'em seemed to 'ave much liking for it.
    Peter Gubbins told 'im not to shoot at 'im because he 'ad a 'ole in his
    pocket, and Bill Chambers, when it pointed at 'im, up and told 'im to let
    somebody else 'ave a turn.  The only one that didn't flinch was Bob
    Pretty, the biggest poacher and the greatest rascal in Claybury.  He'd
    been making fun o' the tricks all along, saying out loud that he'd seen
    'em all afore&mdash;and done better.
</p>
<p>
    "Go on," he ses; "I ain't afraid of you; you can't shoot straight."
</p>
<p>
    The conjurer pointed the pistol at 'im.  Then 'e pulled the trigger and
    the pistol went off bang, and the same moment o' time Bob Pretty jumped
    up with a 'orrible scream, and holding his 'ands over 'is eyes danced
    about as though he'd gone mad.
</p>
<p>
    Everybody started up at once and got round 'im, and asked 'im wot was the
    matter; but Bob didn't answer 'em.  He kept on making a dreadful noise,
    and at last 'e broke out of the room and, holding 'is 'andkercher to 'is
    face, ran off 'ome as 'ard as he could run.
</p>
<p>
    "You've done it now, mate," ses Bill Chambers to the conjurer.  "I
    thought you wouldn't be satisfied till you'd done some 'arm.  You've been
    and blinded pore Bob Pretty."
</p>
<p>
    "Nonsense," ses the conjurer.  "He's frightened, that's all."
</p>
<p>
    "Frightened!"  ses Peter Gubbins.  "Why, you fired Dicky Weed's watch
    straight into 'is face."
</p>
<p>
    "Rubbish," ses the conjurer; "it dropped into 'is pocket, and he'll find
    it there when 'e comes to 'is senses."
</p>
<p>
    "Do you mean to tell me that Bob Pretty 'as gone off with my watch in 'is
    pocket?"  screams Dicky Weed.
</p>
<p>
    "I do," ses the other.
</p>
<p>
    "You'd better get 'old of Bob afore 'e finds it out, Dicky," ses Bill
    Chambers.
</p>
<p>
    Dicky Weed didn't answer 'im; he was already running along to Bob
    Pretty's as fast as 'is legs would take 'im, with most of us follering
    behind to see wot 'appened.

<p>
    The door was fastened when we got to it, but Dicky Weed banged away at it
    as 'ard as he could bang, and at last the bedroom winder went up and
    Mrs. Pretty stuck her 'ead out.
</p>
<p>
    "H'sh!" she ses, in a whisper.  "Go away."
</p>
<p>
    "I want to see Bob," ses Dicky Weed.
</p>
<p>
    "You can't see 'im," ses Mrs. Pretty.  "I'm getting 'im to bed.  He's
    been shot, pore dear.  Can't you 'ear 'im groaning?"
</p>
<p>
    We 'adn't up to then, but a'most direckly arter she 'ad spoke you could
    ha' heard Bob's groans a mile away.  Dreadful, they was.
</p>
<p>
    "There, there, pore dear," ses Mrs. Pretty.
</p>
<p>
    "Shall I come in and 'elp you get 'im to bed?" ses Dicky Weed, 'arf
    crying.
</p>
<p>
    "No, thank you, Mr. Weed," ses Mrs. Pretty.  "It's very kind of you to
    offer, but 'e wouldn't like any hands but mine to touch 'im.  I'll send
    in and let you know 'ow he is fust thing in the morning."
</p>
<p>
    "Try and get 'old of the coat, Dicky," ses Bill Chambers, in a whisper.
    "Offer to mend it for 'im.  It's sure to want it."
</p>
<p>
    "Well, I'm sorry I can't be no 'elp to you," ses Dicky Weed, "but I
    noticed a rent in Bob's coat and, as 'e's likely to be laid up a bit, it
    ud be a good opportunity for me to mend it for 'im.  I won't charge 'im
    nothing.  If you drop it down I'll do it now."
</p>
<p>
    "Thankee," ses Mrs. Pretty; "if you just wait a moment I'll clear the
    pockets out and drop it down to you."
</p>
<p>
    She turned back into the bedroom, and Dicky Weed ground 'is teeth
    together and told Bill Chambers that the next time he took 'is advice
    he'd remember it.  He stood there trembling all over with temper, and
    when Mrs. Pretty came to the winder agin and dropped the coat on his 'ead
    and said that Bob felt his kindness very much, and he 'oped Dicky ud make
    a good job of it, because it was 'is favrite coat, he couldn't speak.
    He stood there shaking all over till Mrs. Pretty 'ad shut the winder down
    agin, and then 'e turned to the conjurer, as 'ad come up with the rest of
    us, and asked 'im wot he was going to do about it now.
</p>
<p>
    "I tell you he's got the watch," ses the conjurer, pointing up at the
    winder.  "It went into 'is pocket.  I saw it go.  He was no more shot
    than you were.  If 'e was, why doesn't he send for the doctor?"
</p>
<p>
    "I can't 'elp that," ses Dicky Weed.  "I want my watch or else twenty
    pounds."
</p>
<p>
    "We'll talk it over in a day or two," ses the conjurer.  "I'm giving my
    celebrated entertainment at Wickham Fair on Monday, but I'll come back
    'ere to the Cauliflower the Saturday before and give another
    entertainment, and then we'll see wot's to be done.  I can't run away,
    because in any case I can't afford to miss the fair."
</p>
<p>
    Dicky Weed gave way at last and went off 'ome to bed and told 'is wife
    about it, and listening to 'er advice he got up at six o'clock in the
    morning and went round to see 'ow Bob Pretty was.
</p>
<p>
    Mrs. Pretty was up when 'e got there, and arter calling up the stairs to
    Bob told Dicky Weed to go upstairs.  Bob Pretty was sitting up in bed
    with 'is face covered in bandages, and he seemed quite pleased to see
    'im.
</p>
<p>
    "It ain't everybody that ud get up at six o'clock to see 'ow I'm getting
    on," he ses.  "You've got a feeling 'art, Dicky."
</p>
<p>
    Dicky Weed coughed and looked round, wondering whether the watch was in
    the room, and, if so, where it was hidden.
</p>
<p>
    "Now I'm 'ere I may as well tidy up the room for you a bit," he ses,
    getting up.  "I don't like sitting idle."
</p>
<p>
    "Thankee, mate," ses Bob; and 'e lay still and watched Dicky Weed out of
    the corner of the eye that wasn't covered with the bandages.
</p>
<p>
    I don't suppose that room 'ad ever been tidied up so thoroughly since the
    Prettys 'ad lived there, but Dicky Weed couldn't see anything o' the
    watch, and wot made 'im more angry than anything else was Mrs. Pretty
    setting down in a chair with 'er 'ands folded in her lap and pointing out
    places that he 'adn't done.
</p>
<p>
    "You leave 'im alone," ses Bob.  "<i>He knows wot 'e's arter</i>.  Wot did you
    do with those little bits o' watch you found when you was bandaging me
    up, missis?"
</p>
<p>
    "Don't ask me," ses Mrs. Pretty.  "I was in such a state I don't know wot
    I was doing 'ardly."
</p>
<p>
    "Well, they must be about somewhere," ses Bob.  "You 'ave a look for 'em,
    Dicky, and if you find 'em, keep 'em.  They belong to you."
</p>
<p>
    Dicky Weed tried to be civil and thank 'im, and then he went off 'ome and
    talked it over with 'is wife agin.  People couldn't make up their minds
    whether Bob Pretty 'ad found the watch in 'is pocket and was shamming, or
    whether 'e was really shot, but they was all quite certain that,
    whichever way it was, Dicky Weed would never see 'is watch agin.
</p>
<p>
    On the Saturday evening this 'ere Cauliflower public-'ouse was crowded,
    everybody being anxious to see the watch trick done over agin.  We had
    'eard that it 'ad been done all right at Cudford and Monksham; but Bob
    Pretty said as 'ow he'd believe it when 'e saw it, and not afore.
</p>
<p>
    He was one o' the fust to turn up that night, because 'e said 'e wanted
    to know wot the conjurer was going to pay him for all 'is pain and
    suffering and having things said about 'is character.  He came in leaning
    on a stick, with 'is face still bandaged, and sat right up close to the
    conjurer's table, and watched him as 'ard as he could as 'e went through
    'is tricks.
</p>
<p>
    "And now," ses the conjurer, at last, "I come to my celebrated watch
    trick.  Some of you as wos 'ere last Tuesday when I did it will remember
    that the man I fired the pistol at pretended that 'e'd been shot and run
    off 'ome with it in 'is pocket."
</p>
<p>
    "You're a liar!"  ses Bob Pretty, standing up.  "Very good," ses the
    conjurer; "you take that bandage off and show us all where you're hurt."
</p>
<p>
    "I shall do nothing o' the kind," ses Bob.  I don't take my orders from
    you."
</p>
<p>
    "Take the bandage off," ses the conjurer, "and if there's any shot marks
    I'll give you a couple o' sovereigns."
</p>
<p>
    "I'm afraid of the air getting to it," ses Bob Pretty.
</p>
<p>
    "You don't want to be afraid o' that, Bob," ses John Biggs, the
    blacksmith, coming up behind and putting 'is great arms round 'im.  "Take
    off that rag, somebody; I've got hold of 'im."
</p>
<p>
    Bob Pretty started to struggle at fust, but then, seeing it was no good,
    kept quite quiet while they took off the bandages.
</p>
<p>
    "There!  look at 'im," ses the conjurer, pointing.  "Not a mark on 'is
    face, not one."
</p>
<p>
    "Wet!" ses Bob Pretty.  "Do you mean to say there's no marks?"
</p>
<p>
    "I do," ses the conjurer.
</p>
<p>
    "Thank goodness," ses Bob Pretty, clasping his 'ands.  "Thank goodness!
    I was afraid I was disfigured for life.  Lend me a bit o' looking-glass,
    somebody.  I can 'ardly believe it."
</p>
<p>
    "You stole Dicky Weed's watch," ses John Biggs.  "I 'ad my suspicions of
    you all along.  You're a thief, Bob Pretty.  That's wot you are."
</p>
<p>
    "Prove it," ses Bob Pretty.  "You 'eard wot the conjurer said the other
    night, that the last time he tried 'e failed, and 'ad to give
    eighteenpence to the man wot the watch 'ad belonged to."
</p>
<p>
    "That was by way of a joke like," ses the conjurer to John Biggs.  "I can
    always do it.  I'm going to do it now.  Will somebody 'ave the kindness
    to lend me a watch?"
</p>
<p>
    He looked all round the room, but nobody offered&mdash;except other men's
    watches, wot wouldn't lend 'em.
</p>
<p>
    "Come, come," he ses; "ain't none of you got any trust in me?  It'll be
    as safe as if it was in your pocket.  I want to prove to you that this
    man is a thief."
</p>
<p>
    He asked 'em agin, and at last John Biggs took out 'is silver watch and
    offered it to 'im on the understanding that 'e was on no account to fire
    it into Bob Pretty's pocket.
</p>
<p>
    "Not likely," ses the conjurer.  "Now, everybody take a good look at this
    watch, so as to make sure there's no deceiving."
</p>
<p>
    He 'anded it round, and arter everybody 'ad taken a look at it 'e took it
    up to the table and laid it down.
</p>
<p>
    "Let me 'ave a look at it," ses Bob Pretty, going up to the table.  "I'm
    not going to 'ave my good name took away for nothing if I can 'elp it."
</p>
<p>
    He took it up and looked at it, and arter 'olding it to 'is ear put it
    down agin.
</p>
<p>
    "Is that the flat-iron it's going to be smashed with?"  he ses.
</p>
<p>
    "It is," ses the conjurer, looking at 'im nasty like; "p'r'aps you'd like
    to examine it."
</p>
<p>
    Bob Pretty took it and looked at it. "Yes, mates," he ses, "it's a
    ordinary flat-iron.  You couldn't 'ave anything better for smashing a
    watch with."
</p>
<p>
    He 'eld it up in the air and, afore anybody could move, brought it down
    bang on the face o' the watch.  The conjurer sprang at 'im and caught at
    'is arm, but it was too late, and in a terrible state o' mind 'e turned
    round to John Biggs.

<p>
    "He's smashed your watch," he ses; "he's smashed your watch."
</p>
<p>
    "Well," ses John Biggs, "it 'ad got to be smashed, 'adn't it?"
</p>
<p>
    "Yes, but not by 'im," ses the conjurer, dancing about.  "I wash my 'ands
    of it now."
</p>
<p>
    "Look 'ere," ses John Biggs; "don't you talk to me about washing your
    'ands of it.  You finish your trick and give me my watch back agin same
    as it was afore."
</p>
<p>
    "Not now he's been interfering with it," ses the conjurer.  "He'd better
    do the trick now as he's so clever."
</p>
<p>
    "I'd sooner 'ave you do it," ses John Biggs.  "Wot did you let 'im
    interfere for?"
</p>
<p>
    "'Ow was I to know wot 'e was going to do?"  ses the conjurer.  "You must
    settle it between you now.  I'll 'ave nothing more to do with it."
</p>
<p>
    "All right, John Biggs," ses Bob Pretty; "if 'e won't do it, I will.  If
    it can be done, I don't s'pose it matters who does it.  I don't think
    anybody could smash up a watch better than that."
</p>
<p>
    John Biggs looked at it, and then 'e asked the conjurer once more to do
    the trick, but 'e wouldn't.
</p>
<p>
    "It can't be done now," he ses; "and I warn you that if that pistol is
    fired I won't be responsible for what'll 'appen."
</p>
<p>
    "George Kettle shall load the pistol and fire it if 'e won't," ses Bob
    Pretty.  "'Aving been in the Militia, there couldn't be a better man for
    the job."
</p>
<p>
    George Kettle walked up to the table as red as fire at being praised like
    that afore people and started loading the pistol.  He seemed to be more
    awkward about it than the conjurer 'ad been the last time, and he 'ad to
    roll the watch-cases up with the flat-iron afore 'e could get 'em in.
    But 'e loaded it at last and stood waiting.
</p>
<p>
    "Don't shoot at me, George Kettle," ses Bob.  "I've been called a thief
    once, and I don't want to be agin."
</p>
<p>
    "Put that pistol down, you fool, afore you do mischief," ses the
    conjurer.
</p>
<p>
    "Who shall I shoot at?"  ses George Kettle, raising the pistol.
</p>
<p>
    "Better fire at the conjurer, I think," ses Bob Pretty; "and if things
    'appen as he says they will 'appen, the watch ought to be found in 'is
    coat-pocket."
</p>
<p>
    "Where is he?"  ses George, looking round.
</p>
<p>
    Bill Chambers laid 'old of 'im just as he was going through the door to
    fetch the landlord, and the scream 'e gave as he came back and George
    Kettle pointed the pistol at 'im was awful.

<p>
    "It's no worse for you than it was for me," ses Bob.
</p>
<p>
    "Put it down," screams the conjurer; "put it down.  You'll kill 'arf the
    men in the room if it goes off."
</p>
<p>
    "Be careful where you aim, George," ses Sam Jones.  "P'r'aps he'd better
    'ave a chair all by hisself in the middle of the room."
</p>
<p>
    It was all very well for Sam Jones to talk, but the conjurer wouldn't sit
    on a chair by 'imself.  He wouldn't sit on it at all.  He seemed to be
    all legs and arms, and the way 'e struggled it took four or five men to
    'old 'im.
</p>
<p>
    "Why don't you keep still?"  ses John Biggs.  "George Kettle'll shoot it
    in your pocket all right.  He's the best shot in Claybury."
</p>
<p>
    "Help!  Murder!" says the conjurer, struggling.  "He'll kill me.  Nobody
    can do the trick but me."
</p>
<p>
    "But you say you won't do it," ses John Biggs.  "Not now," ses the
    conjurer; "I can't."
</p>
<p>
    "Well, I'm not going to 'ave my watch lost through want of trying," ses
    John Biggs.  "Tie 'im to the chair, mates."
</p>
<p>
    "All right, then," ses the conjurer, very pale.  "Don't tie me; I'll sit
    still all right if you like, but you'd better bring the chair outside in
    case of accidents.  Bring it in the front."
</p>
<p>
    George Kettle said it was all nonsense, but the conjurer said the trick
    was always better done in the open air, and at last they gave way and
    took 'im and the chair outside.
</p>
<p>
    "Now," ses the conjurer, as 'e sat down, "all of you go and stand near
    the man woe's going to shoot.  When I say 'Three,' fire.  Why!  there's
    the watch on the ground there!"
</p>
<p>
    He pointed with 'is finger, and as they all looked down he jumped up out
    o' that chair and set off on the road to Wickham as 'ard as 'e could run.
    It was so sudden that nobody knew wot 'ad 'appened for a moment, and then
    George Kettle, wot 'ad been looking with the rest, turned round and
    pulled the trigger.
</p>
<p>
    There was a bang that pretty nigh deafened us, and the back o' the chair
    was blown nearly out.  By the time we'd got our senses agin the conjurer
    was a'most out o' sight, and Bob Pretty was explaining to John Biggs wot
    a good job it was 'is watch 'adn't been a gold one.
</p>
<p>
    "That's wot comes o' trusting a foreigner afore a man wot you've known
    all your life," he ses, shaking his 'ead.  "I 'ope the next man wot tries
    to take my good name away won't get off so easy.  I felt all along the
    trick couldn't be done; it stands to reason it couldn't.  I done my best,
    too."

<h2>
    ADMIRAL PETERS
</h2>
<p>
    Mr. George Burton, naval pensioner, sat at the door of his lodgings
    gazing in placid content at the sea.  It was early summer, and the air
    was heavy with the scent of flowers; Mr. Burton's pipe was cold and
    empty, and his pouch upstairs.  He shook his head gently as he realised
    this, and, yielding to the drowsy quiet of his surroundings, laid aside
    the useless pipe and fell into a doze.
</p>
<a name="image-68"><!--IMG--></a>

</center>
<!--IMAGE END-->
<p>
    He was awakened half an hour later by the sound of footsteps.  A tall,
    strongly built man was approaching from the direction of the town, and
    Mr. Burton, as he gazed at him sleepily, began to wonder where he had
    seen him before.  Even when the stranger stopped and stood smiling down
    at him his memory proved unequal to the occasion, and he sat staring at
    the handsome, shaven face, with its little fringe of grey whisker,
    waiting for enlightenment.
</p>
<p>
    "George, my buck," said the stranger, giving him a hearty slap on the
    shoulder, "how goes it?"
</p>
<p>
		"D&mdash; <i>Bless</i> my eyes, I mean," said Mr.
    Burton, correcting himself, "if it ain't Joe Stiles.  I didn't know you
    without your beard."
</p>
<p>
    "That's me," said the other.  "It's quite by accident I heard where you
    were living, George; I offered to go and sling my hammock with old Dingle
    for a week or two, and he told me.  Nice quiet little place, Seacombe.
    Ah, you were lucky to get your pension, George."
</p>
<p>
    "I deserved it," said Mr. Burton, sharply, as he fancied he detected
    something ambiguous in his friend's remark.
</p>
<p>
    "Of course you did," said Mr. Stiles; "so did I, but I didn't get it.
    Well, it's a poor heart that never rejoices.  What about that drink you
    were speaking of, George?"
</p>
<p>
    "I hardly ever touch anything now," replied his friend.
</p>
<p>
    "I was thinking about myself," said Mr. Stiles.  "I can't bear the stuff,
    but the doctor says I must have it.  You know what doctors are, George!"
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Burton did not deign to reply, but led the way indoors.
</p>
<p>
    "Very comfortable quarters, George," remarked Mr. Stiles, gazing round
    the room approvingly; "ship-shape and tidy.  I'm glad I met old Dingle.
    Why, I might never ha' seen you again; and us such pals, too."
</p>
<p>
    His host grunted, and from the back of a small cupboard, produced a
    bottle of whisky and a glass, and set them on the table.  After a
    momentary hesitation he found another glass.
</p>
<p>
    "Our noble selves," said Mr. Stiles, with a tinge of reproach in his
    tones, "and may we never forget old friendships."
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Burton drank the toast.  "I hardly know what it's like now, Joe," he
    said, slowly.  "You wouldn't believe how soon you can lose the taste for
    it."
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Stiles said he would take his word for it.  "You've got some nice
    little public-houses about here, too," he remarked.  "There's one I
    passed called the Cock and Flowerpot; nice cosy little place it would be
    to spend the evening in."
</p>
<p>
    "I never go there," said Mr. Burton, hastily.  "I&mdash;a friend o' mine here
    doesn't approve o' public-'ouses."
</p>
<p>
    "What's the matter with him?"  inquired his friend, anxiously.
</p>
<p>
    "It's&mdash;it's a 'er," said Mr. Burton, in some confusion.
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Stiles threw himself back in his chair and eyed him with amazement.
    Then, recovering his presence of mind, he reached out his hand for the
    bottle.
</p>
<p>
    "We'll drink her health," he said, in a deep voice.  "What's her name?"
</p>
<p>
    "Mrs. Dutton," was the reply.
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Stiles, with one hand on his heart, toasted her feelingly; then,
    filling up again, he drank to the "happy couple."
</p>
<p>
    "She's very strict about drink," said Mr. Burton, eyeing these
    proceedings with some severity.
</p>
<p>
    "Any&mdash;dibs?"  inquired Mr. Stiles, slapping a pocket which failed to ring
    in response.
</p>
<p>
    "She's comfortable," replied the other, awkwardly.  "Got a little
    stationer's shop in the town; steady, old-fashioned business.  She's
    chapel, and very strict."
</p>
<p>
    "Just what you want," remarked Mr. Stiles, placing his glass on the
    table.  "What d'ye say to a stroll?"
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Burton assented, and, having replaced the black bottle in the
    cupboard, led the way along the cliffs toward the town some half-mile
    distant, Mr. Stiles beguiling the way by narrating his adventures since
    they had last met.  A certain swagger and richness of deportment were
    explained by his statement that he had been on the stage.
</p>
<p>
    "Only walking on," he said, with a shake of his head.  "The only speaking
    part I ever had was a cough.  You ought to ha' heard that cough, George!"
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Burton politely voiced his regrets and watched him anxiously.  Mr.
    Stiles, shaking his head over a somewhat unsuccessful career, was making
    a bee-line for the Cock and Flowerpot.
</p>
<p>
    "Just for a small soda," he explained, and, once inside, changed his mind
    and had whisky instead.  Mr. Burton, sacrificing principle to friendship,
    had one with him.  The bar more than fulfilled Mr. Stiles's ideas as to
    its cosiness, and within the space of ten minutes he was on excellent
    terms with the regular clients.  Into the little, old-world bar, with its
    loud-ticking clock, its Windsor-chairs, and its cracked jug full of
    roses, he brought a breath of the bustle of the great city and tales of
    the great cities beyond the seas.  Refreshment was forced upon him, and
    Mr. Burton, pleased at his friend's success, shared mildly in his
    reception.  It was nine o'clock before they departed, and then they only
    left to please the landlord.
</p>
<p>
    "Nice lot o' chaps," said Mr. Stiles, as he stumbled out into the sweet,
    cool air.  "Catch hold&mdash;o' my&mdash;arm, George.  Brace me&mdash;up a bit."
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Burton complied, and his friend, reassured as to his footing, burst
    into song.  In a stentorian voice he sang the latest song from comic
    opera, and then with an adjuration to Mr. Burton to see what he was
    about, and not to let him trip, he began, in a lumbering fashion, to
    dance.
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Burton, still propping him up, trod a measure with fewer steps, and
    cast uneasy glances up the lonely road.  On their left the sea broke
    quietly on the beach below; on their right were one or two scattered
    cottages, at the doors of which an occasional figure appeared to gaze
    in mute astonishment at the proceedings.
</p>
<p>
    "Dance, George," said Mr. Stiles, who found his friend rather an
    encumbrance.
</p>
<p>
    "Hs'h!  Stop!" cried the frantic Mr. Burton, as he caught sight of a
    woman's figure bidding farewell in a lighted doorway.
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Stiles replied with a stentorian roar, and Mr. Burton, clinging
    despairingly to his jigging friend lest a worse thing should happen, cast
    an imploring glance at Mrs. Dutton as they danced by.  The evening was
    still light enough for him to see her face, and he piloted the corybantic
    Mr. Stiles the rest of the way home in a mood which accorded but ill with
    his steps.
</p>
<p>
    His manner at breakfast next morning was so offensive that Mr. Stiles,
    who had risen fresh as a daisy and been out to inhale the air on the
    cliffs, was somewhat offended.
</p>
<p>
    "You go down and see her," he said, anxiously.  "Don't lose a moment; and
    explain to her that it was the sea-air acting on an old sunstroke."
</p>
<p>
    "She ain't a fool," said Mr. Burton, gloomily.
</p>
<p>
    He finished his breakfast in silence, and, leaving the repentant Mr.
    Stiles sitting in the doorway with a pipe, went down to the widow's to
    make the best explanation he could think of on the way.  Mrs. Dutton's
    fresh-coloured face changed as he entered the shop, and her still good
    eyes regarded him with scornful interrogation.
</p>
<p>
    "I&mdash;saw you last night," began Mr. Burton, timidly.
</p>
<p>
    "I saw you, too," said Mrs. Dutton.  "I couldn't believe my eyesight at
    first."
</p>
<p>
    "It was an old shipmate of mine," said Mr. Burton.  "He hadn't seen me
    for years, and I suppose the sight of me upset 'im."
</p>
<p>
    "I dare say," replied the widow; "that and the Cock and Flowerpot, too.
    I heard about it."
</p>
<p>
    "He would go," said the unfortunate.
</p>
<p>
    "You needn't have gone," was the reply.
</p>
<p>
    "I 'ad to," said Mr. Burton, with a gulp; "he&mdash;he's an old officer o'
    mine, and it wouldn't ha' been discipline for me to refuse."
</p>
<p>
    "Officer?"  repeated Mrs. Dutton.
</p>
<p>
    "My old admiral," said Mr. Burton, with a gulp that nearly choked him.
    "You've heard me speak of Admiral Peters?"
</p>
<p>
    "<i>Admiral?</i>"  gasped the astonished widow.
</p>
<p>
    "What, a-carrying on like that?"
</p>
<p>
    "He's a reg'lar old sea-dog," said Mr. Burton.  "He's staying with me,
    but of course 'e don't want it known who he is.  I couldn't refuse to
    'ave a drink with 'im.  I was under orders, so to speak."
</p>
<p>
    "No, I suppose not," said Mrs. Dutton, softening.  "Fancy him staying
    with you!"
</p>
<p>
    "He just run down for the night, but I expect he'll be going 'ome in an
    hour or two," said Mr. Burton, who saw an excellent reason now for
    hastening his guest's departure.
</p>
<p>
    Mrs. Dutton's face fell.  "Dear me," she murmured, "I should have liked
    to have seen him; you have told me so much about him.  If he doesn't go
    quite so soon, and you would like to bring him here when you come
    to-night, I'm sure I should be very pleased."
</p>
<p>
    "I'll mention it to 'im," said Mr. Burton, marvelling at the change in
    her manner.
</p>
<p>
    "Didn't you say once that he was uncle to Lord Buckfast?" inquired Mrs.
    Dutton, casually.
</p>
<p>
    "Yes," said Mr. Burton, with unnecessary doggedness; "I did."
</p>
<p>
    "The idea of an admiral staying with you!" said Mrs. Dutton.
</p>
<p>
    "Reg'lar old sea-dog," said Mr. Burton again; "and, besides, he don't
    want it known.  It's a secret between us three, Mrs. Dutton."
</p>
<p>
    "To be sure," said the widow.  "You can tell the admiral that I shall not
    mention it to a soul," she added, mincingly.
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Burton thanked her and withdrew, lest Mr. Stiles should follow him up
    before apprised of his sudden promotion.  He found that gentleman,
    however, still sitting at the front door, smoking serenely.
</p>
<p>
    "I'll stay with you for a week or two," said Mr. Stiles, briskly, as soon
    as the other had told his story.  "It'll do you a world o' good to be
    seen on friendly terms with an admiral, and I'll put in a good word for
    you."
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Burton shook his head.  "No, she might find out," he said, slowly.
    "I think that the best thing is for you to go home after dinner, Joe, and
    just give 'er a look in on the way, p'r'aps.  You could say a lot o'
    things about me in 'arf an hour."
</p>
<p>
    "No, George," said Mr. Stiles, beaming on him kindly; "when I put my hand
    to the plough I don't draw back.  It's a good speaking part, too, an
    admiral's.  I wonder whether I might use old Peters's language."
</p>
<p>
    "Certainly not," said Mr. Burton, in alarm.
</p>
<p>
    "You don't know how particular she is."
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Stiles sighed, and said that he would do the best he could without
    it.  He spent most of the day on the beach smoking, and when evening came
    shaved himself with extreme care and brushed his serge suit with great
    perseverance in preparation for his visit.
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Burton performed the ceremony of introduction with some awkwardness;
    Mr. Stiles was affecting a stateliness of manner which was not without
    distinction; and Mrs. Dutton, in a black silk dress and the cameo brooch
    which had belonged to her mother, was no less important.  Mr. Burton had
    an odd feeling of inferiority.

    "It's a very small place to ask you to, Admiral Peters," said the widow,
    offering him a chair.
</p>
<p>
    "It's comfortable, ma'am," said Mr. Stiles, looking round approvingly.
    "Ah, you should see some of the palaces I've been in abroad; all show and
    no comfort.  Not a decent chair in the place.  And, as for the
    antimacassars&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>
<p>
    "Are you making a long stay, Admiral Peters?"  inquired the delighted
    widow.
</p>
<p>
    "It depends," was the reply.  "My intention was just to pay a flying
    visit to my honest old friend Burton here&mdash;best man in my squadron&mdash;but
    he is so hospitable, he's been pressing me to stay for a few weeks."
</p>
<p>
    "But the admiral says he must get back to-morrow morning," interposed Mr.
    Burton, firmly.
</p>
<p>
    "Unless I have a letter at breakfast-time, Burton," said Mr. Stiles,
    serenely.
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Burton favoured him with a mutinous scowl.
</p>
<p>
    "Oh, I do hope you will," said Mrs. Dutton.
</p>
<p>
    "I have a feeling that I shall," said Mr. Stiles, crossing glances with
    his friend.  "The only thing is my people; they want me to join them at
    Lord Tufton's place."
</p>
<p>
    Mrs. Dutton trembled with delight at being in the company of a man with
    such friends.  "What a change shore-life must be to you after the perils
    of the sea!" she murmured.
</p>
<p>
    "Ah!" said Mr. Stiles.  "True!  True!"
</p>
<p>
    "The dreadful fighting," said Mrs. Dutton, closing her eyes and
    shuddering.
</p>
<p>
    "You get used to it," said the hero, simply.  "Hottest time I had I think
    was at the bombardment of Alexandria.  I stood alone.  All the men who
    hadn't been shot down had fled, and the shells were bursting round me
    like&mdash;like fireworks."
</p>
<p>
    The widow clasped her hands and shuddered again.
</p>
<p>
    "I was standing just behind 'im, waiting any orders he might give," said
    Mr. Burton.
</p>
<p>
    "Were you?" said Mr. Stiles, sharply&mdash;"were you?  I don't remember it,
    Burton."
</p>
<p>
    "Why," said Mr. Burton, with a faint laugh, "I was just behind you, sir.
    If you remember, sir, I said to you that it was pretty hot work."
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Stiles affected to consider.  "No, Burton," he said, bluffly&mdash;"no; so
    far as my memory goes I was the only man there."
</p>
<p>
    "A bit of a shell knocked my cap off, sir," persisted Mr. Burton, making
    laudable efforts to keep his temper.
</p>
<p>
    "That'll do, my man," said the other, sharply; "not another word.  You
    forget yourself."
</p>
<p>
    He turned to the widow and began to chat about "his people" again to
    divert her attention from Mr. Burton, who seemed likely to cause
    unpleasantness by either bursting a blood-vessel or falling into a fit.
</p>
<p>
    "My people have heard of Burton," he said, with a slight glance to see
    how that injured gentleman was progressing.  "He has often shared my
    dangers.  We have been in many tight places together.  Do you remember
    those two nights when we were hidden in the chimney at the palace of the
    Sultan of Zanzibar, Burton?"
</p>
<p>
    "I should think I do," said Mr. Burton, recovering somewhat.
</p>
<p>
    "Stuck so tight we could hardly breathe," continued the other.
</p>
<p>
    "I shall never forget it as long as I live," said Mr. Burton, who thought
    that the other was trying to make amends for his recent indiscretion.
</p>
<p>
    "Oh, do tell me about it, Admiral Peters," cried Mrs. Dutton.
</p>
<p>
    "Surely Burton has told you that?"  said Mr. Stiles.
</p>
<p>
    "Never breathed a word of it," said the widow, gazing somewhat
    reproachfully at the discomfited Mr. Burton.
</p>
<p>
    "Well, tell it now, Burton," said Mr. Stiles.
</p>
<p>
    "You tell it better than I do, sir," said the other.
</p>
<p>
    "No, no," said Mr. Stiles, whose powers of invention were not always to
    be relied upon.  "You tell it; it's your story."
</p>
<p>
    The widow looked from one to the other.  "It's your story, sir," said Mr.
    Burton.
</p>
<p>
    "No, I won't tell it," said Mr. Stiles.  "It wouldn't be fair to you,
    Burton.  I'd forgotten that when I spoke.  Of course, you were young at
    the time, still&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>
<p>
    "I done nothing that I'm ashamed of, sir," said Mr. Burton, trembling
    with passion.
</p>
<p>
    "I think it's very hard if I'm not to hear it," said Mrs. Dutton, with
    her most fascinating air.
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Stiles gave her a significant glance, and screwing up his lips nodded
    in the direction of Mr. Burton.
</p>
<p>
    "At any rate, you were in the chimney with me, sir," said that
    unfortunate.
</p>
<p>
    "Ah!" said the other, severely.  "But what was I there for, my man?"
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Burton could not tell him; he could only stare at him in a frenzy of
    passion and dismay.
</p>
<p>
    "What were you there for, Admiral Peters?"  inquired Mrs. Dutton.
</p>
<p>
    "I was there, ma'am," said the unspeakable Mr. Stiles, slowly&mdash;"I was
    there to save the life of Burton.  I never deserted my men&mdash;-never.
    Whatever scrapes they got into I always did my best to get them out.
    News was brought to me that Burton was suffocating in the chimney of the
    Sultan's favourite wife, and I&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>
<p>
    "Sultan's favourite wife!"  gasped Mrs. Dutton, staring hard at Mr.
    Burton, who had collapsed in his chair and was regarding the ingenious
    Mr. Stiles with open-mouthed stupefaction.  "Good gracious!  I&mdash;I never
    heard of such a thing.  I am surprised!"
</p>
<p>
    "So am I," said Mr. Burton, thickly.  "I&mdash;I&mdash;-"
</p>
<p>
    "How did you escape, Admiral Peters?"  inquired the widow, turning from
    the flighty Burton in indignation.
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Stiles shook his head.  "To tell you that would be to bring the
    French Consul into it," he said, gently.  "I oughtn't to have mentioned
    the subject at all.  Burton had the good sense not to."
</p>
<p>
    The widow murmured acquiescence, and stole a look at the prosaic figure
    of the latter gentleman which was full of scornful curiosity.  With some
    diffidence she invited the admiral to stay to supper, and was obviously
    delighted when he accepted.
</p>
<p>
    In the character of admiral Mr. Stiles enjoyed himself amazingly, his one
    regret being that no discriminating theatrical manager was present to
    witness his performance.  His dignity increased as the evening wore on,
    and from good-natured patronage of the unfortunate Burton he progressed
    gradually until he was shouting at him.  Once, when he had occasion to
    ask Mr. Burton if he intended to contradict him, his appearance was so
    terrible that his hostess turned pale and trembled with excitement.
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Burton adopted the air for his own use as soon as they were clear of
    Mrs. Dutton's doorstep, and in good round terms demanded of Mr. Stiles
    what he meant by it.
</p>
<p>
    "It was a difficult part to play, George," responded his friend.  "We
    ought to have rehearsed it a bit.  I did the best I could."
</p>
<p>
    "Best you could?"  stormed Mr. Burton.  "Telling lies and ordering me
    about?"
</p>
<p>
    "I had to play the part without any preparation, George," said the other,
    firmly.  "You got yourself into the difficulty by saying that I was the
    admiral in the first place.  I'll do better next time we go."
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Burton, with a nasty scowl, said that there was not going to be any
    next time, but Mr. Stiles smiled as one having superior information.
    Deaf first to hints and then to requests to seek his pleasure elsewhere,
    he stayed on, and Mr. Burton was soon brought to realise the difficulties
    which beset the path of the untruthful.
</p>
<p>
    The very next visit introduced a fresh complication, it being evident to
    the most indifferent spectator that Mr. Stiles and the widow were getting
    on very friendly terms.  Glances of unmistakable tenderness passed
    between them, and on the occasion of the third visit Mr. Burton sat an
    amazed and scandalised spectator of a flirtation of the most pronounced
    description.  A despairing attempt on his part to lead the conversation
    into safer and, to his mind, more becoming channels only increased his
    discomfiture.  Neither of them took any notice of it, and a minute later
    Mr. Stiles called the widow a "saucy little baggage," and said that she
    reminded him of the Duchess of Marford.

<p>
    "I used to think she was the most charming woman in England," he said,
    meaningly.
</p>
<p>
    Mrs. Dutton simpered and looked down; Mr. Stiles moved his chair a little
    closer to her, and then glanced thoughtfully at his friend.
</p>
<p>
    "Burton," he said.
</p>
<p>
    "Sir," snapped the other.
</p>
<p>
    "Run back and fetch my pipe for me," said Mr. Stiles.  "I left it on the
    mantelpiece."
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Burton hesitated, and, the widow happening to look away, shook his
    fist at his superior officer.
</p>
<p>
    "Look sharp," said Mr. Stiles, in a peremptory voice.
</p>
<p>
    "I'm very sorry, sir," said Mr. Burton, whose wits were being sharpened
    by misfortune, "but I broke it."
</p>
<p>
    "Broke it?"  repeated the other.
</p>
<p>
    "Yes, sir," said Mr. Burton.  "I knocked it on the floor and trod on it
    by accident; smashed it to powder."
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Stiles rated him roundly for his carelessness, and asked him whether
    he knew that it was a present from the Italian Ambassador.
</p>
<p>
    "Burton was always a clumsy man," he said, turning to the widow.  "He had
    the name for it when he was on the <i>Destruction</i> with me; 'Bungling
    Burton' they called him."
</p>
<p>
    He divided the rest of the evening between flirting and recounting
    various anecdotes of Mr. Burton, none of which were at all flattering
    either to his intelligence or to his sobriety, and the victim, after one
    or two futile attempts at contradiction, sat in helpless wrath as he saw
    the infatuation of the widow.  They were barely clear of the house before
    his pent-up emotions fell in an avalanche of words on the faithless Mr.
    Stiles.
</p>
<p>
    "I can't help being good-looking," said the latter, with a smirk.
</p>
<p>
    "Your good looks wouldn't hurt anybody," said Mr. Burton, in a grating
    voice; "it's the admiral business that fetches her.  It's turned 'er
    head."
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Stiles smiled.  "She'll say 'snap' to my 'snip' any time," he
    remarked.  "And remember, George, there'll always be a knife and fork
    laid for you when you like to come."
</p>
<p>
    "I dessay," retorted Mr. Burton, with a dreadful sneer.  "Only as it
    happens I'm going to tell 'er the truth about you first thing to-morrow
    morning.  If I can't have 'er you sha'n't."
</p>
<p>
    "That'll spoil your chance, too," said Mr. Stiles.  "She'd never forgive
    you for fooling her like that.  It seems a pity neither of us should get
    her."
</p>
<p>
    "You're a sarpent," exclaimed Mr. Burton, savagely&mdash;"a sarpent that I've
    warmed in my bosom and&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>
<p>
    "There's no call to be indelicate, George," said Mr. Stiles, reprovingly,
    as he paused at the door of the house.  "Let's sit down and talk it over
    quietly."
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Burton followed him into the room and, taking a chair, waited.
</p>
<p>
    "It's evident she's struck with me," said Mr. Stiles, slowly; "it's also
    evident that if you tell her the truth it might spoil my chances.  I
    don't say it would, but it might.  That being so, I'm agreeable to going
    back without seeing her again by the six-forty train to-morrow morning if
    it's made worth my while."
</p>
<p>
    "Made worth your while?"  repeated the other.
</p>
<p>
    "Certainly," said the unblushing Mr. Stiles.  "She's not a bad-looking
    woman&mdash;for her age&mdash;and it's a snug little business."
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Burton, suppressing his choler, affected to ponder.  "If 'arf a
    sovereign&mdash;" he said, at last.
</p>
<p>
    "Half a fiddlestick!" said the other, impatiently.  "I want ten pounds.
    You've just drawn your pension, and, besides, you've been a saving man
    all your life."
</p>
<p>
    "Ten pounds?" gasped the other.  "D'ye think I've got a gold-mine in the
    back garden?"
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Stiles leaned back in his chair and crossed his feet.  "I don't go
    for a penny less," he said, firmly.  "Ten pounds and my ticket back.  If
    you call me any more o' those names I'll make it twelve."
</p>
<p>
    "And what am I to explain to Mrs. Dutton?"  demanded Mr. Burton, after a
    quarter of an hour's altercation.
</p>
<p>
    "Anything you like," said his generous friend.  "Tell her I'm engaged to
    my cousin, and our marriage keeps being put off and off on account of my
    eccentric behaviour.  And you can say that that was caused by a splinter
    of a shell striking my head.  Tell any lies you like; I shall never turn
    up again to contradict them.  If she tries to find out things about the
    admiral, remind her that she promised to keep his visit here secret."
</p>
<p>
    For over an hour Mr. Burton sat weighing the advantages and disadvantages
    of this proposal, and then&mdash;Mr. Stiles refusing to seal the bargain
    without&mdash;shook hands upon it and went off to bed in a state of mind
    hovering between homicide and lunacy.
</p>
<p>
    He was up in good time next morning, and, returning the shortest possible
    answers to the remarks of Mr. Stiles, who was in excellent feather, went
    with him to the railway station to be certain of his departure.
</p>
<p>
    It was a delightful morning, cool and bright, and, despite his
    misfortunes.  Mr. Burton's spirits began to rise as he thought of his
    approaching deliverance.  Gloom again overtook him at the booking-office,
    where the unconscionable Mr. Stiles insisted firmly upon a first-class
    ticket.
</p>
<p>
    "Who ever heard of an admiral riding third?"  he demanded, indignantly.
</p>
<p>
    "But they don't know you're an admiral," urged Mr. Burton, trying to
    humour him.
</p>
<p>
    "No; but I feel like one," said Mr. Stiles, slapping his pocket.  "I've
    always felt curious to see what it feels like travelling first-class;
    besides, you can tell Mrs. Dutton."
</p>
<p>
    "I could tell 'er that in any case," returned Mr. Burton.
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Stiles looked shocked, and, time pressing, Mr. Burton, breathing so
    hard that it impeded his utterance, purchased a first-class ticket and
    conducted him to the carriage.  Mr. Stiles took a seat by the window and
    lolling back put his foot up on the cushions opposite.  A large bell rang
    and the carriage-doors were slammed.
</p>
<p>
    "Good-bye, George," said the traveller, putting his head to the window.
    "I've enjoyed my visit very much."
</p>
<p>
    "Good riddance," said Mr. Burton, savagely.

<p>
    Mr. Stiles shook his head.  "I'm letting you off easy," he said, slowly.
    "If it hadn't ha' been for one little thing I'd have had the widow
    myself."
</p>
<p>
    "What little thing?"  demanded the other, as the train began to glide
    slowly out.
</p>
<p>
    "My wife," said Mr. Stiles, as a huge smile spread slowly over his face.
    "Good-bye, George, and don't forget to give my love when you go round."

works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

     http://www.gutenberg.net/etext06

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

     http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
     http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
